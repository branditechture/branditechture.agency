Onboarding new customers can strain services, hinder sales, and lower satisfaction. To tackle this challenge, businesses rely on CRM software to manage customers, boost sales, and improve service.</p>
<h2>What is CRM and Why do You Need It?</h2>
<p>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) encompasses the technology utilized to oversee all interactions and relationships with both current and potential customers within a company.

<p>CRM software directs attention towards nurturing relationships within your organization, whether with customers, service recipients, colleagues, or suppliers, across their entire lifecycle. This includes acquiring new customers, securing their patronage, and providing ongoing support and additional services throughout the association.</p>
