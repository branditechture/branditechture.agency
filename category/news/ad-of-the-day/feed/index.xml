										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Salvation Army</em></strong> took to their newly-launched website <strong><a href="https://trulydestroyed.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">trulydestroyed.com</a>, </strong>to unveil a new collection of <em>limited-edition</em> shoes which were previously worn by homeless people. It took inspiration from the latest collection from Balenciaga which features &#8216;destroyed&#8217; gear and will earn money for charity.Â Â </p>
<p><strong>Just so you know, the Salvation Army is a non-profit organisation that works around the world to collect and distribute second-hand clothing.</strong></p>
<p>The organization &#8220;<em>takes on&#8221;</em> the luxury fashion house Balenciaga which recently launched its <em>Paris Sneaker</em> line that includes 100 pairs of limited-edition &#8216;destroyed&#8217; sneakers priced at <strong>$1,850 each.Â </strong></p>
<div id="attachment_16888" style="width: 1410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16888" class="size-full wp-image-16888" title="Truly Destroyed Shoes. ðŸ“· Carli Hermes/The Salvation Army" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/the-salvation-army-truly-destroyed-balenciaga-paris-sneaker-carli-hermes-inequality-awareness-02.jpg" alt="Truly Destroyed Shoes. ðŸ“· Carli Hermes/The Salvation Army" width="1400" height="934" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/the-salvation-army-truly-destroyed-balenciaga-paris-sneaker-carli-hermes-inequality-awareness-02.jpg 1400w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/the-salvation-army-truly-destroyed-balenciaga-paris-sneaker-carli-hermes-inequality-awareness-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/the-salvation-army-truly-destroyed-balenciaga-paris-sneaker-carli-hermes-inequality-awareness-02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/the-salvation-army-truly-destroyed-balenciaga-paris-sneaker-carli-hermes-inequality-awareness-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/the-salvation-army-truly-destroyed-balenciaga-paris-sneaker-carli-hermes-inequality-awareness-02-480x320.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/the-salvation-army-truly-destroyed-balenciaga-paris-sneaker-carli-hermes-inequality-awareness-02-1320x881.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-16888" class="wp-caption-text">Truly Destroyed Shoe. ðŸ“· Carli Hermes/The Salvation Army</p></div>
<p>Shot by photographer <em>Carli Hermes</em>, the shoe contains a unique description like John&#8217;s Truly Destroyed all-purpose shoe, and product details like freezing winter has worn out effect, not waterproof, detached sole, various holes for warm weather, and painful fit.</p>
<p><em>Cloudfactory</em>, an Amsterndam-based creative agency, directed and created the campaign, and all the funds raised will go directly to The Dutch Salvation Army&#8217;s mission to help people in need rebuild their lives.Â </p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, the fashion world is all about how clothes and shoes appear,&#8221; Thamar Keuning, marketing and communications head of <a href="https://www.reshare.nl/english" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Salvation Army ReShare</a>, (<em>Leger des Hells ReShare</em> in the Netherlands), stated. High fashion, or, for that matter, Balenciaga, can be wonderful in terms of innovation and variety.</p>
<p>It is, however, occasionally at odds with what clothing signifies to the vast majority of the individuals we work with, which is purely functional. The destroyed shoes of a homeless person opposite the high-fashion products of this fashion industry represent the world&#8217;s inequality both literally and symbolically.Â </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing that the conversation is changed from a fashion gimmick and fuss to real social concern, such as the enormous number of homeless people in the Netherlands &#8211; there are currently 32,000! For years, we have advocated for the housing of homeless people as well as the problem is now receiving the international attention it deserves as a result of initiatives like these.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not against Balenciaga&#8217;s destroyed sneakers at all. They were successful in capturing everyone&#8217;s attention.Â </p>
<p>&#8220;However, I&#8217;m in where I can help the homeless &#8211; the number of whom appears to be one on the rise again, with such a fantastic idea. The backstory appeals to me. This isn&#8217;t only about photography for me &#8211; it&#8217;s also about art direction. Because the concept is solid, I believe I could develop it further in photography.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cloudfactory&#8217;s creative director Julio Alvarez, added: &#8220;We have a lot of respect for Demna Gvasaline&#8217;s vision, the creative director of Balenciaga, and what he is doing with the Balenciaga brand &#8211; they often tap brilliantly into the (pop) culture,&#8221; We recognize that the fashion industry has its codes, and we are not here to pass judgment.Â </p>
<p>&#8220;It gives us a good starting point for bringing a tougher reality to the news.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apple revealed a creative new twist to its famous &#8216;Silhouettes&#8217; campaign today. The new iteration, which stars pop&#8217;s golden child Harry Styles, highlights AirPods with Spatial Audio.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://branditechture.agency/a-very-brief-history-of-tv-advertising/">advertisements</a>, which are an ode to the original 2003 campaign designed and directed by a media agency called <em>TBWA\Chiat\Day</em>, debuted just weeks after Apple announced that it is discontinuing all iPods and will no longer sell the once-coveted devices.</p>
<p>The original ad featured black silhouettes of people dancing against vividly coloured backdrops while wearing the instantly recognised white outline of an iPod connected to wired earbuds.</p>
<p>The campaign began with billboards in Los Angeles and was followed by placements in print and television across the country. The TV commercials were made memorable by energetic melodies by artists such as the Black Eyed Peas and N.E.R.D.</p>
<p>&#8216;Silhouettes&#8217; was published at a time when Apple â€” notably the iPod â€” was at the centre of our cultural consciousness.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s stock price soared to a 52-week high of $53.20 a share when Bono, leader of the Dublin-based rock band <a class="extlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U2</a>, endorsed the iPhone, calling it &#8220;the most beautiful thing art in music culture since the electric guitar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The famous color-block imagery has now evolved â€“ with the silhouettes in the new spot getting as brightly toned as their backdrops. Instead of iPods, dancers are adorned with the very vivid image of Apple AirPods.</p>
<p>Harry Styles is seen dancing and singing in trippy multiples of his own image to illustrate the product&#8217;s Spatial Audio function, which promises surround-sound, theater-like audio experiences, giving the listener the impression that the sound is emanating from all around them.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is &#8216;Music for a Sushi Restaurant,&#8217; a tune from Styles&#8217; recently released third studio album &#8216;Harry&#8217;s House.&#8217;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_16023" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16023" class="wp-image-16023 size-full" title="Harry Styles Dancing to the Silhouette Apple Airpod Spatial Audio Ad" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Harry-Styles-in-New-Apple-Spatial-Audio-Ad-.png" alt="Harry Styles in New Apple Spatial Audio Ad" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Harry-Styles-in-New-Apple-Spatial-Audio-Ad-.png 1600w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Harry-Styles-in-New-Apple-Spatial-Audio-Ad--300x169.png 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Harry-Styles-in-New-Apple-Spatial-Audio-Ad--1024x576.png 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Harry-Styles-in-New-Apple-Spatial-Audio-Ad--768x432.png 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Harry-Styles-in-New-Apple-Spatial-Audio-Ad--1536x864.png 1536w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Harry-Styles-in-New-Apple-Spatial-Audio-Ad--480x270.png 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Harry-Styles-in-New-Apple-Spatial-Audio-Ad--1320x743.png 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-16023" class="wp-caption-text">Harry Styles in New Apple Spatial Audio Ad</p></div></p>
<p>The new campaign which was created by TBWAMedia Arts Lab in collaboration with Iconoclast and Versatile, continues Apple&#8217;s legacy of partnering with big-names in the music industry.</p>
<p>In the past, the tech brand has collaborated on ads and activations with celebrities such as Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, U2, and Coldplay.</p>
<p>The commercials will air on television, YouTube, and in out-of-home and retail locations across the United States.</p>
<p>Acting on a special request from Harry Styles, Apple will donate the artist&#8217;s appearance and performance fee to the charitable group <a class="extlink" href="https://www.rescue.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">International Rescue Committee</a>, which works to alleviate humanitarian crises across the world.</p>
