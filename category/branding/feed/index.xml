										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not everything is rosy when starting a beauty brand, and brand naming is one of them — You&#8217;d need to brainstorm and conclude on a brand name to use, complete the business registration process with the <a href="https://branditechture.agency/here-is-why-your-business-is-tagged-inactive-on-the-cac-registry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corporate registry</a>, set up your office or workspace, set up social media accounts, and <a href="https://branditechture.agency/lets-build-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build a website.</a></p>
<p>Building a brand is just like birthing and raising a child. Whatever you do to or for the child as a parent plays a huge role in determining whether or not the child will grow into an admirable person. This also means that whatever procedure you employ while <a href="https://branditechture.agency/7-secrets-to-building-and-sustaining-brand-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setting up your brand</a> must be deliberate. One of such is choosing a <a href="https://branditechture.agency/top-6-factors-to-consider-when-naming-a-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand name.</a></p>
<p>As with any other business, <a href="https://branditechture.agency/top-6-factors-to-consider-when-naming-a-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choosing a brand name</a> for your beauty brand is crucial to its long-term <a href="https://branditechture.agency/8-ways-your-small-business-can-benefit-from-branding/">success,</a> and as a <a href="https://daytonacollege.edu/blog/becoming-a-beauty-entrepreneur/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">beauty entrepreneur</a>, choosing a brand name is one of the most challenging parts of starting your new business venture. Brand names are very key to your entire brand: They could limit you, make you, or even mar you.</p>
<p>Your brand name is the first thing a <a href="https://branditechture.agency/job/graphic-designer/">logo designer</a> would ask you when developing a visual <a href="https://branditechture.agency/branding-packages/">brand identity</a> for your beauty brand.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, if you have to <a href="https://branditechture.agency/what-to-do-when-your-brand-gets-messed-up/">change your brand name in the future</a>, you&#8217;d have to spend a lot of resources and go through some stressful legal and publicity processes. This is why it is very important to get it right the first time.</p>
<pre><strong>Confused? Don't be!</strong> 
We can help you come up with a brand name for your beauty brand with our professional <a href="https://branditechture.agency/get-started/">brand naming service.</a></pre>
<h2>How to choose a brand name for your beauty brand</h2>
<p>Now, try to imagine a few beauty brands that inspire you, then see the first 3 brand names that pop up in your head. What makes these brands distinguishable from each other? Are they easy to relate to, spell and remember? — These are things you should <a href="https://branditechture.agency/top-6-factors-to-consider-when-naming-a-brand/">consider</a> when choosing your own beauty brand name too.</p>
<h2>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Name for Your Beauty Brand</h2>
<p>Okay, let&#8217;s get more precise and discuss a few factors that you should consider when choosing a brand name for your beauty business.</p>
<h3>1. Name Availability</h3>
<p>You mustn&#8217;t just pick a name and be done with it, that won&#8217;t work and you might end up having to change the name in just a matter of weeks. You might even find yourself entangled in a <a href="https://branditechture.agency/lessons-to-learn-from-lil-nas-xs-satan-shoes-saga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal battle with another brand</a> for copyright issues. This could effectively result in loss of money and integrity to your new business, and may even extend to you as a person.</p>
<p>To avoid all of these issues, it is better that you check for the availability of the name you have chosen first before using it at all. It is even advisable to have about 3 names you like and see which one is available for use.</p>
<h3>2. Your Brand Image</h3>
<p>Your brand name is a reflection of your brand image. It speaks about who you are, what you stand for, and what you intend to do with your brand. What unique values are you proposing with your new beauty brand? Whatever name you choose must be able to portray these values.</p>
<p>If your brand image is supposed to be classy and elegant, this means that the brand name too should follow suit. This means you cannot use just any name. Using a name that depicts your beauty brand makes your brand name memorable.</p>
<h3>3. How Big You Want Your Brand (To Appear)</h3>
<p>One of the common branding <a href="https://branditechture.agency/10-common-branding-mistakes-you-must-avoid/">mistakes</a> that people make is choosing limiting names for their brand. Sometimes, people limit their brand names by location, geography, or even after a single service without considering the possibility of expanding into other territories in the future.</p>
<p>This is why it is important you think about how big you want it now. No matter how big or small you are starting out, you should ideally choose a brand name that can allow for the expansion of your beauty brand in the future.</p>
<h2>How to Choose a Name for Your Beauty Brand</h2>
<h3>Choose a Name that is Creative and Relevant</h3>
<p>Even though it is a beauty brand, the names you will be choosing must be not only creative but also relevant to what your brand is all about. Brand Names Generators like <a class="extlink" href="https://namelix.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Namelix</a> are cool, but use the right keywords to ensure that the name has some appeal and stays relevant to your brand.</p>
<h3>Choose a Name that is Easy to Spell and Pronounce</h3>
<p>There is always a chance that people will forget or misspell your beauty brand name, which is why you should make it easy to spell and remember. Out of sight, they say, is out of mind.</p>
<p>This means that if your brand name is too difficult then most people would not remember it. You might have to do extra work to make your name known. Choosing a name that is easy to remember is important.</p>
<p>Think about it like you want to choose a name that will become a household name known to everyone. What name do you think that should be? You can keep writing it down and putting it together over and over until you fine a name that resonates the most.</p>
<h3>Check for Its Availability</h3>
<p>Remember that one of the factors to consider when choosing a name for your beauty brand is the availability of the name. Think about your social media handles, your email addresses, and your website&#8217;s domain name. I am very sure you don&#8217;t want to have to include numbers on your social media handles.</p>
<p>To check the availability of domain names and social media handles all at once, you can use a tool like <a class="extlink" href="https://www.namecheckr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Namecheckr</a>.</p>
<p>Choosing a name for your beauty brand is highly important, but ensuring that it is available for use is much more important.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Names are very important, and no one likes to be called names that will make people laugh at them or question their parent&#8217;s choices. Parents also choose names that will depict how they see their child or how they want their child to be seen.  This same analogy can be employed when naming your beauty brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://branditechture.agency/what-elon-teaches-us-about-branding/">Brand naming</a> is a very important part of your brand and just choosing the right name can be the ultimate selling point for your brand. In summary, when choosing a name for your beauty brand, ensure that it is relevant, easy to spell and pronounce, and unique.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As thousands of businesses try to make a name for themselves worldwide, building a unique brand identity has become crucial for your business to stand out and distinguish itself from other competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brand&#8221; and ”Logo&#8221; are <a href="https://branditechture.agency/branding-vs-logo-design/">two very different terms</a>, yet they are often used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Although a logo can be regarded as the symbol of a business entity, it is really not the entirety of a brand.</p>
<p>In reality, creating a logo is just one of the many checklists for building a unique <a href="https://branditechture.agency/branding-packages/">brand identity.</a></p>
<h2>What is a logo?</h2>
<p>A logo is a symbol that may be made up of text, images and/or illustrations. It helps your business to visually distinguish itself from other brands.</p>
<p>A logo is ideally regarded as the “face” of your business; It represents your business on letterheads, business cards, promo banner, event backdrops, website, app stores, social media pages, invoices, payment forms, souvenirs among other brand assets.</p>
<h2>What is a brand?</h2>
<p>A brand is simply the overall <strong>public perception</strong> of a particular business, service, or product.</p>

<p><cite>Jeff Bezos (Founder of Amazon)</cite></p></blockquote>
<h2>What is branding?</h2>
<p>Branding is the strategy of <strong>improving the overall public perception and uniqueness</strong> of a given business, service or product.</p>
<p><strong>You may like to read: <a target="_blank" href="https://branditechture.agency/branding-vs-marketing-7-differences/" title="Branding Vs Marketing — 7 Differences No One Told You" rel="noopener">Branding Vs Marketing — 7 Differences No One Told You</a></strong></p>
<h2>So, how can I make my brand unique?</h2>
<p>To be a successful and memorable brand, you have to apply the following guidelines;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Know your competitors </strong><br />
Knowing your competitors is a crucial step towards standing out and building a competitive advantage. However, this would require that you do some market research.For example, studying reviews from customers of your competitors can reveal certain opportunities which may help you reposition your brand, help you stand out and eventually win over some of your competitors’ customers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep It Simple</strong><br />
<a href="https://branditechture.agency/branding-packages" class="rank-math-link">Get a logo</a>, but keep it simple and memorable.<br />
You don’t have to go overboard with complex logo designs to prove a point, just keep your logo clean and simple.<br />
If you already have an existing logo, you might either want to take a second look at it yourself or let us do that for you by uploading it in the comment section below.</li>
<li><strong>Be Coherent In your communications</strong><br />
As a brand, maintaining a coherent design language across all your communication channels will only yield positive results. Not only would it put your brand on a pedestal, but it would also earn you some “easy” trust by making your brand look less confusing to prospects.To achieve this, <a href="https://branditechture.agency/branding-packages" class="rank-math-link">get your logo done by a professional. </a>Stick to a colour scheme, and make sure you follow other guidelines such as typography, imagery, as advised in your Brand Guide book.</p>
<p>Don’t know what a Brand Guide Book is? <a class="extlink" aria-label="Click Here to see an example. (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/branditechture/branditechture.github.io/raw/master/Owanbe%20Buka%20Brand%20Guide%20by%20Branditechture%20Design%20Agency.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click Here to download an example Brand Guide (PDF | 2.79MB).</a></p>
<p>You may have noticed that at this point, it is already getting beyond just your logo, but the way which you communicate with your target audience (colours, voice, typography etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Get some branded assets</strong><br />
Branded assets are also called brand collateral for a reason.Do not underestimate how much that branded merchandise can hype your brand and amplify your voice in the most unexpected of places.</p>
<p>It doesn’t cost much to get your logo slapped on a t-shirt, but just make sure that the colours agree with your brand (or follows your brand guidelines). Believe me, it would be worth every penny spent.</li>
<li><strong>Be your own brand ambassador</strong><br />
There is no better way to stand out and create a deep connection with your audience than being your own brand ambassador.You are your brand. Own it, eat it, drink it, wear it, use it, and flaunt it. If you have employees, encourage them to primarily use your products, but you may not force them.</p>
<p>Patronize your business first, and show the world you are confident about your brand. This evokes emotion and builds your brand’s credibility over time.</li>
<li><strong>Make use of subtle marketing tactics</strong><br />
Subtle marketing is also commonly referred to as Indirect Marketing.Subtle marketing creeps into the hearts of your audience. Your audience slowly absorbs your message subconsciously due to its passive nature.</p>
<p>Subtle marketing is humane, sensational and not lousy.</p>
<p>Examples of subtle marketing include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Content marketing</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Search Engine Optimization</li>
<li>Participation in social initiatives</li>
<li>Donations to NGOs</li>
<li>Social Media PR</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Subtle persuasion in marketing will help your brand create a longer-lasting impact. It is relatively more effective than the common aggressive and direct marketing strategy.</p>

<p>Finally, if your goal is to build respect and ultimately make your brand stand out, then aggressive marketing strategies such as e-mail blasting, spamming, intrusive and annoying WhatsApp broadcasting, etc., should never be used as your primary marketing strategy.</p>

<p>Illegal marketing tactics such as empty promises, bulk e-mail purchase, use of megaphones in restricted areas, loud music etc., should not even be given a second thought.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Facebook, Inc.</strong> has just changed its name to become <strong>&#8220;Meta, Inc.,&#8221;</strong> but will also be referred to as <strong>Meta Platforms, Inc.</strong></p>
<p>Apparently, the name change will concern the parent company for reasons of clarity, but the name of the various social networks, including Facebook, will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>According to Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook; the metaverse represents the future of the Internet, after computers and mobile phones, to which the public will have access to interact, work or be entertained via technologies (augmented reality glasses, virtual reality headsets, etc. ).</p>
<p>This name change is interpreted as a distraction manoeuvre by critics of the Californian group, entangled in scandals and controversies, from disinformation to data confidentiality and respect for competition law, but that is none of our business here 😃 — The purpose of this article is to share the new &#8220;Facebook&#8221; <strong>Meta logo </strong>with you so that you can have a high-fidelity logo to work with whenever the need arises.</p>
<p><a href="https://branditechture.agency/">Branditechture</a> loves high-quality stuff, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve painstakingly undergone a process which involved manually reproducing different formats of the logo which was found in the news earlier today (October 29, 2021).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, there.</p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://branditechture.agency/here-is-why-your-business-is-tagged-inactive-on-the-cac-registry/">wrote an article</a> about the Corporate Affairs Commission, but as we faced a challenge while looking for a quality logo of the CAC to use. We could not get a high-quality logo for the CAC on Google and the official CAC website, so we resorted to creating one for ourselves. We are sharing this CAC logo because we know that a lot of people (e.g Consultants, Accredited Registrars, Students, Designers) would definitely find it very useful and time-saving.</p>

But the truth is that regardless of how big (or small) your business is, if you&#8217;re in business, you need to <a href="https://branditechture.agency/8-ways-your-small-business-can-benefit-from-branding/">think about branding</a>.</p>
<p>Larger companies have more money to spend on <a href="https://branditechture.agency/branding-packages/">branding</a>. Nonetheless, you don&#8217;t need an Apple-sized bank account to start from scratch with a successful branding plan.</p>

<p>There are many things you can do to help your business stand out, attract customers&#8217; attention, and make a lasting impression on them without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you can brand your business with these 8 simple branding tips that work all the time:</p>
<h2>1. Be Open and Honest</h2>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t want people to know who you are now, soon enough, they will. As a result, always strive to create a brand that reflects your <strong>actual values</strong> and one you would be pleased to represent. That way, when information about you is discovered, no one is surprised because they already know, like, and trust you.</p>
<div id="attachment_14388" style="width: 950px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14388" class="wp-image-14388 size-large" title="No Free (Tarot) reading" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/g0pk7c509rs-1024x768.jpg" alt="No Free tarot reading " width="940" height="705" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/g0pk7c509rs-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/g0pk7c509rs-300x225.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/g0pk7c509rs-768x576.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/g0pk7c509rs-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/g0pk7c509rs-480x360.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/g0pk7c509rs-1320x990.jpg 1320w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/g0pk7c509rs.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><p id="caption-attachment-14388" class="wp-caption-text">Sign card that reads &#8220;no free (Tarot) reading&#8221;. Freebie lovers, keep off.</p></div>
<h2>2. Focus on One Audience</h2>
<p>Remember that you know exactly who you want in your audience, and you&#8217;ll tailor all of your marketing materials to appeal to that one specific group. This implies you put your blinders on and don&#8217;t care about alienating a few people who might not buy your goods, instead, focus on appealing to a niche-specific target group.</p>
<div id="attachment_14381" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jy9mxva15w0.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14381" class="wp-image-14381 size-medium" title="Focus on the goal: Target a specific audience" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jy9mxva15w0-200x300.jpg" alt="Focus on the goal: Target a specific audience" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jy9mxva15w0-200x300.jpg 200w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jy9mxva15w0-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jy9mxva15w0-768x1153.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jy9mxva15w0-480x721.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jy9mxva15w0.jpg 799w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-14381" class="wp-caption-text">Focus on the goal: Target a specific audience</p></div>
<h2>3. Send information to list members on a regular basis</h2>
<p>Sending emails to list members on a regular basis is one approach to ensure that you stay in touch with your audience. One method to achieve this is to use the <a href="https://branditechture.agency/insider/">&#8220;newsletter&#8221; concept</a>, giving a regular update of what you&#8217;ve shared across social media and your blog in one place.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;20 Content-Generation Ideas for Your Brand&#8217;s Marketing&#8221; &#8212; Branditechture" src="https://branditechture.agency/20-content-generation-ideas-for-your-brands-marketing/embed/#?secret=AeZnSOQwpJ#?secret=J7sf691ck5" data-secret="J7sf691ck5" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<h2>4. Consider Sponsored Advertisements (Especially on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube)</h2>
<p>The era of free marketing is coming to an end. It is possible to market free content, but it will take a long time. Spend some money on promotion, at least on these platforms, if you want to move things along faster. To ensure that your paid and free material is seen by as many people as possible, market it to your audience.</p>
<h2>5. Use Your Blog to Share Long-Form Content</h2>
<p>Longer blog posts are more crucial than ever before. When you upload extended content, it demonstrates that you&#8217;re an expert because you can go into great detail about a topic that interests your audience. It also gives search engines the impression that your site is authoritative.</p>
<h2>6. Make your website mobile-friendly.</h2>
<p>Today, a mobile-first strategy is more important than a &#8220;mobile-friendly&#8221; website. Your site must function both on and off mobile platforms, but if you design for mobile-first, it will also function and look great on non-mobile platforms.</p>

<h2>7. Make Use of the Social Media Platforms That Your Audience Prefers</h2>
<p>While you may want to be everywhere, focus on the platform that your target audience uses the most. You may need to experiment to see where you get the greatest traction, but if you do, make it your primary platform.</p>
<h2>8. Participate in Live Events</h2>
<div id="attachment_12956" style="width: 1090px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12956" class="wp-image-12956 size-full" title="Yusuf Odukoya at Alliance de Francais" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Yusuf-Odukoya-at-Alliance-de-Francais.jpeg" alt="Yusuf Odukoya at Alliance de Francais" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Yusuf-Odukoya-at-Alliance-de-Francais.jpeg 1080w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Yusuf-Odukoya-at-Alliance-de-Francais-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Yusuf-Odukoya-at-Alliance-de-Francais-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Yusuf-Odukoya-at-Alliance-de-Francais-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Yusuf-Odukoya-at-Alliance-de-Francais-480x320.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><p id="caption-attachment-12956" class="wp-caption-text">Yusuf Odukoya, Founder and CEO of Branditechture at Alliance de Francais in 2021</p></div>
<p>This holds true whether the live event takes place online, such as a live webinar or a live YouTube event, or in person, such as a seminar or workshop. It&#8217;s critical that you follow your target audience.</p>

<p>You might define branding as the process of creating a visual representation and the overall effort taken by an organization to ensure that everyone gets a clear view of the company&#8217;s values. Branding gives more <a href="https://branditechture.agency/how-to-use-brand-clarity-to-improve-your-marketing-message/">clarity</a> to any business or company and improves its perception among the general public.</p>
<p>In this article, I will use the Nike brand to illustrate the difference between<strong> logo design</strong> and <strong>branding.</strong></p>
<p>A checkmark or Swoosh is how Nike depicts its brand. A very simple form that indicates movement and speed is included. That&#8217;s excellent, but it&#8217;s only a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>logo</strong></span>, a simple form.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Nike brand</strong></span> encompasses advertisements, corporate communications, brand <a href="https://branditechture.agency/how-a-brand-ambassador-can-help-grow-your-company/">ambassadors</a>, product packaging, store design, sponsorship programs, TV product placement and movies, sponsorship, in-store graphics, hang-tags, music in videos, website design, print ads, product photography, technology, and so on&#8230; You will have all of these perks with Nike. This is branding.</p>

<p>Branding is more than just logo design. It is extremely beneficial to businesses and organizations of all shapes and sizes. If your budget supports it, do branding so that everything runs in an interoperable manner. Branding has much <a href="https://branditechture.agency/8-ways-your-small-business-can-benefit-from-branding/">bigger impact</a> than logo design.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many business owners believe that a decent logo design will function the same way.</p>
<h2>Nike Brand Strategy 101</h2>
<p>Nike&#8217;s branding strategy is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The logo is seen by potential clients.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Since the logo (i.e the checkmark, and the NIKE wordmark) is known to them, they will recall all of their previous interactions with the brand &#8211; commercials, product experiences, seeing your neighbours or friends wearing Nike clothing, packaging, and social interactions. You mention companies, celebrity endorsements, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> This recollection elicits an emotional and cognitive reaction. Yes! This is a company I&#8217;m familiar with! I&#8217;m familiar with their offerings, and they&#8217;re fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> They choose to get a pair of the most recent Nike shoes.</p>
<p>As you can see, logos are just visual lines in the brain that help people remember their interactions with businesses (also known as &#8220;brands&#8221;!) Emotional reactions are triggered by the memory of a brand experience!</p>
<p>So, how important is the logo and branding in order to get satisfying results and to ensure that everyone is aware of the product and services you offer?</p>
