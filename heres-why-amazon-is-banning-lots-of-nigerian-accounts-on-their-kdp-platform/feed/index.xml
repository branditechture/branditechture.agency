					<description><![CDATA[Those greedy affiliate marketers are the problems we are having, they are so keen on the#20,000 that they always collect from new student 
I was particularly talking about this issue on one of the Amazon kdp groups, I was attacked by all those Amazon kdp spoilers...

What I always tell people is this , if you are not an exceptional writer why go to Amazon kdp ?.

But they won&#039;t listen everybody wants to make quick money with stress and skill
.
The affiliate marketers are the ones to be blame  , they are the Genesis of these problem, even genuine authors too have been affected.


I think it is high time we report them to Amazon kdp before they kick all of us out of Amazon]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So one of them is currently facing prosecution after I filed petition against him. I am permitted to disclose only a limited part of the content here for confidential reasons. 

“Good afternoon!
Sir, after going through [this post] and the follow up comments, I figured out why most online companies are banning Nigerians from their platforms. People like this man Yusuf, is responsible for all the bans Nigerian online hustlers get from foreign companies. And what I did call &quot;racism&quot; [here] happened to be a direct effect of what this man and his colleagues are doing for their living. They teach people to become criminals and spoil the reputation of Nigeria.




 
I found a person on my WhatsApp by name “Yusuf” training other people online on how to pirate other people&#039;s books and I begged him to stop but he insisted he would not. He said there&#039;s a way a non writer could publish a 400 page book without holding a pen and a paper. And he is selling a course to train non writers on how to do this. The problem is that, his students in turn would turn into coaches themselves and train more people. Writers suffer so much from these pirates, and now they have emerged online.  While promoting book piracy, plagiarism, criminality, he is also destroying other people&#039;s means of livelihood and the reputation of an entire country. Just like Yahoo boys are spoiling Nigeria&#039;s reputation by scamming large quantities of people, so do these coaches spoil Nigerian writers&#039; names by training large numbers of students (non writers) on how to make money pirating other people&#039;s books online. They tell them, &quot;You don&#039;t have to be a writer to make money on KDP.&quot; And non writers rush to learn how to make money publishing books without shedding a sweat or raising a pen.

I have his contact on my WhatsApp. I  have enough evidence and more details you might need but I don&#039;t have money to file a lawsuit but I thought maybe you might have some way to help stop him, stop book piracy in Nigeria, and save the hardworking Nigerian authors from these confident cyber thieves. There are thousands of them, training hundreds of thousands of people to pirate people&#039;s books on Amazon. As a result, Amazon KDP is banning most Nigerian author accounts. Please I have one of these criminals and he is so confident, he says he wouldn&#039;t stop.






Details:
 &quot;He&quot; in the context below refers to &quot;Yusuf.&quot; And &quot;he&quot; also refers to every other coach who promote similar contents on the internet.

•	He trains people to produce pirated books, or  little or no content eBooks (e.g. one or two empty pages with good cover design) on Amazon KDP, destroying the platform&#039;s legitimacy.
•	Because most of these problems come from Nigerian users, Amazon bans Nigerians from most of its services, affecting the genuine writers who depend upon the platform for their livelihood.
•	Amazon does not allow Nigerians to join their affiliate marketing program, and Amazon does not allow Nigerians to download the Kindle mobile app for reasons related to this.
•	He tells his students that they don&#039;t need to be writers to make money off writing, and that KDP is a spot where they can earn in dollars WITHOUT writing.
•	KDP means Kindle Direct Publishing, the largest online publishing house for writers owned by Amazon. It is free hence these pirates have the opportunity to exploit it.
•	He tells them they can write 200- 400 pages of books without holding a pen or paper (nor typing a single word on the computer), and publish such books on KDP and start earning.
•	He teaches them to design new covers of already existing books and republish them, thereby diminishing the original publisher&#039;s sales and destroying the trust his readers have for him.
•	He trains his students to write titles of best selling books and make a slightly different cover (to invest particularly in the cover design so it looks more attractive than the original book, yet different so Amazon&#039;s algorithm does not recognize any similarities.)
•	He trains his students to put only one or two pages in these beautifully packaged books, since they are not writers and cannot write. And an unsuspecting buyer gets a package he didn&#039;t expect, losing trust for both the writer and the platform.
•	Oftentimes, he teaches his students to use &quot;pen names&quot; which aren&#039;t their original names; but which is the original pen name of the author of the best selling book they are pirating.
•	He tells them they don&#039;t need to be writers to make money on Amazon KDP, a platform designed wholly for writers and publishers to publish and distribute their books.
•	He tells them Amazon KDP is a new way to make quick money online, and they rush to learn by buying his courses. In this way, he makes money by promoting cyber crime.
•	He runs ads all over the internet, corrupting the entire space; spreading fake news. Amazon should be asked to explain how &quot;non writers/publishers could earn from publishing original books on their KDP platform without having to write a single word.&quot; Because these coaches, Yusuf particularly, claim it is possible.
•	His students in-turn become coaches and train other students. And they actually make money off this business, while the original writers cry out for help: when the pirated books sell due to good packaging; the original book doesn&#039;t.
•	Amazon even takes drastic actions against the nuisance and sometimes bans the account of the original writer, because it is related with that of the pirate.
•	By involving in this, Yusuf clearly encourages people to infringe on other people&#039;s copyright which is against Nigeria&#039;s constitution.
•	Yusuf boasts that what he does is right and that he would not stop, even should I report him to authorities.]]></description>

<p>So one of them is currently facing prosecution after I filed petition against him. I am permitted to disclose only a limited part of the content here for confidential reasons. </p>
<p>“Good afternoon!<br />
Sir, after going through this post and the follow up comments, I figured out why most online companies are banning Nigerians from their platforms. People like this man Yusuf, is responsible for all the bans Nigerian online hustlers get from foreign companies. And what I did call &#8220;racism&#8221; here happened to be a direct effect of what this man and his colleagues are doing for their living. They teach people to become criminals and spoil the reputation of Nigeria.</p>
<p>I found a person on my WhatsApp by name “Yusuf” training other people online on how to pirate other people&#8217;s books and I begged him to stop but he insisted he would not. He said there&#8217;s a way a non writer could publish a 400 page book without holding a pen and a paper. And he is selling a course to train non writers on how to do this. The problem is that, his students in turn would turn into coaches themselves and train more people. Writers suffer so much from these pirates, and now they have emerged online.  While promoting book piracy, plagiarism, criminality, he is also destroying other people&#8217;s means of livelihood and the reputation of an entire country. Just like Yahoo boys are spoiling Nigeria&#8217;s reputation by scamming large quantities of people, so do these coaches spoil Nigerian writers&#8217; names by training large numbers of students (non writers) on how to make money pirating other people&#8217;s books online. They tell them, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to be a writer to make money on KDP.&#8221; And non writers rush to learn how to make money publishing books without shedding a sweat or raising a pen.</p>
<p>I have his contact on my WhatsApp. I  have enough evidence and more details you might need but I don&#8217;t have money to file a lawsuit but I thought maybe you might have some way to help stop him, stop book piracy in Nigeria, and save the hardworking Nigerian authors from these confident cyber thieves. There are thousands of them, training hundreds of thousands of people to pirate people&#8217;s books on Amazon. As a result, Amazon KDP is banning most Nigerian author accounts. Please I have one of these criminals and he is so confident, he says he wouldn&#8217;t stop.</p>
<p>Details:<br />
 &#8220;He&#8221; in the context below refers to &#8220;Yusuf.&#8221; And &#8220;he&#8221; also refers to every other coach who promote similar contents on the internet.</p>
<p>•	He trains people to produce pirated books, or  little or no content eBooks (e.g. one or two empty pages with good cover design) on Amazon KDP, destroying the platform&#8217;s legitimacy.<br />
•	Because most of these problems come from Nigerian users, Amazon bans Nigerians from most of its services, affecting the genuine writers who depend upon the platform for their livelihood.<br />
•	Amazon does not allow Nigerians to join their affiliate marketing program, and Amazon does not allow Nigerians to download the Kindle mobile app for reasons related to this.<br />
•	He tells his students that they don&#8217;t need to be writers to make money off writing, and that KDP is a spot where they can earn in dollars WITHOUT writing.<br />
•	KDP means Kindle Direct Publishing, the largest online publishing house for writers owned by Amazon. It is free hence these pirates have the opportunity to exploit it.<br />
•	He tells them they can write 200- 400 pages of books without holding a pen or paper (nor typing a single word on the computer), and publish such books on KDP and start earning.<br />
•	He teaches them to design new covers of already existing books and republish them, thereby diminishing the original publisher&#8217;s sales and destroying the trust his readers have for him.<br />
•	He trains his students to write titles of best selling books and make a slightly different cover (to invest particularly in the cover design so it looks more attractive than the original book, yet different so Amazon&#8217;s algorithm does not recognize any similarities.)<br />
•	He trains his students to put only one or two pages in these beautifully packaged books, since they are not writers and cannot write. And an unsuspecting buyer gets a package he didn&#8217;t expect, losing trust for both the writer and the platform.<br />
•	Oftentimes, he teaches his students to use &#8220;pen names&#8221; which aren&#8217;t their original names; but which is the original pen name of the author of the best selling book they are pirating.<br />
•	He tells them they don&#8217;t need to be writers to make money on Amazon KDP, a platform designed wholly for writers and publishers to publish and distribute their books.<br />
•	He tells them Amazon KDP is a new way to make quick money online, and they rush to learn by buying his courses. In this way, he makes money by promoting cyber crime.<br />
•	He runs ads all over the internet, corrupting the entire space; spreading fake news. Amazon should be asked to explain how &#8220;non writers/publishers could earn from publishing original books on their KDP platform without having to write a single word.&#8221; Because these coaches, Yusuf particularly, claim it is possible.<br />
•	His students in-turn become coaches and train other students. And they actually make money off this business, while the original writers cry out for help: when the pirated books sell due to good packaging; the original book doesn&#8217;t.<br />
•	Amazon even takes drastic actions against the nuisance and sometimes bans the account of the original writer, because it is related with that of the pirate.<br />
•	By involving in this, Yusuf clearly encourages people to infringe on other people&#8217;s copyright which is against Nigeria&#8217;s constitution.<br />
•	Yusuf boasts that what he does is right and that he would not stop, even should I report him to authorities.</p>
