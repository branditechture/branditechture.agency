										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have come across the word &#8220;copy&#8221; in a different context before, but in <a href="https://branditechture.agency/20-content-generation-ideas-for-your-brands-marketing/">content marketing</a>, &#8220;copy&#8221; refers to the text that is used to communicate a message to an audience.</p>
<p>The word, &#8220;Copy&#8221; can be used to refer to anything from blog posts and articles to sales pages and product descriptions. The goal of copy in content marketing is to inform, educate, or persuade the reader to take a specific action, such as purchasing a product or signing up for a newsletter.</p>
<p>Copywriting is the act of creating this written content, and a person who specializes in this type of writing is called a copywriter.</p>
<h3>What is the Difference between copywriting and content writing?</h3>
<p>Copywriting and <a href="https://branditechture.agency/writing-content-for-a-website-read-these-golden-tips/">content writing</a> are similar in that they both involve creating written content, but they have some key differences.</p>
<p>Copywriting is focused on creating persuasive, sales-oriented text that is designed to get the reader to take a specific action, such as purchasing a product or signing up for a service. Content writing, on the other hand, is focused on creating informative and engaging text that provides value to the reader.</p>
<p>Content writing is often used to support the goals of a content marketing strategy by providing useful information to the reader and building trust and credibility for the brand.</p>
<h3>What are the types of copy we have in marketing?</h3>
<p>There are many different types of copy used in marketing. Some examples include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sales copy: This type of copy is used to persuade the reader to make a purchase. It typically includes a highlight of the benefits of the product or service being sold, and a strong call-to-action <a href="https://branditechture.agency/7-amazing-microcopy-tips-for-ux-designers/">microcopy</a> to nudge the reader to make a purchase.</li>
<li>Landing page copy: This type of copy is used on a website&#8217;s landing page, which is the first page a visitor sees when they arrive on the site. It is designed to grab the reader&#8217;s attention and convince them to take a specific action, such as filling out a form or making a purchase.</li>
<li>Email copy: This type of copy is used in email marketing campaigns. It is designed to engage the reader and encourage them to take a specific action, such as clicking a link or making a purchase.</li>
<li>Social media copy: This type of copy is used on social media platforms to engage followers and promote products or services. It is often concise and attention-grabbing, and may include hashtags and links to relevant content.</li>
<li>Blog post copy: This type of copy is used in blog posts and articles. It is designed to inform and educate the reader and may include links to other resources or calls-to-action.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few examples of the many types of copy used in marketing. The specific type of copy that is used will depend on the goals of the marketing campaign and the target audience.</p>
<h3>What are the features of an effective copy?</h3>
<p>An effective copy should have several key features, including:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A clear and compelling message:</strong> The copy should have a clear and concise message that is easy for the reader to understand. It should convey the value of the product or service being offered and convince the reader to take action.</li>
<li><strong>A strong call-to-action:</strong> The copy should include a strong call-to-action that tells the reader exactly what they should do next. This could be to make a purchase, sign up for a newsletter, or follow the business on social media.</li>
<li><strong>Relevance to the target audience:</strong> The copy should be relevant to the target audience and address their needs and concerns. By understanding the audience&#8217;s pain points and interests, businesses can create copy that resonates with them and motivates them to take action.</li>
<li><strong>Use of persuasive techniques:</strong> The copy should use persuasive techniques, such as testimonials, social proof, and scarcity, to convince the reader to take action. By leveraging these techniques, businesses can create copy that is more effective at persuading the reader.</li>
<li><strong>Proper grammar and spelling:</strong> The copy should be well-written, with proper grammar and spelling. This helps to ensure that the message is clear and easy to understand, and it helps to build trust and credibility with the reader.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, an effective copy should be clear, concise, persuasive, and relevant to the target audience. By incorporating these features, businesses can create copy that is more effective at achieving their marketing goals.</p>
<h3>What are the benefits of effective copy?</h3>
<p>Effective copy has many benefits, both for the business and for the audience. Some of the key benefits of effective copy include:</p>
<p><strong>Increased sales:</strong> Effective copy is designed to persuade the reader to take a specific action, such as making a purchase. By creating compelling and persuasive copy, businesses can increase their sales and revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Improved customer engagement:</strong> Good copy is engaging and interesting, which can help to keep the reader&#8217;s attention and encourage them to take action. By providing valuable and interesting information, businesses can build trust and credibility with their audience.</p>
<p><strong>Increased website traffic:</strong> Effective copy can help to drive more traffic to a business&#8217;s website. This can be achieved through search engine optimization (SEO) techniques, such as using relevant keywords, or through social media marketing and email marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Better brand awareness:</strong> Effective copy can help to improve a business&#8217;s brand awareness. By creating consistent and compelling messaging, businesses can build their brand and <a href="https://branditechture.agency/how-to-build-a-unique-brand/">differentiate themselves from their competitors</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Effective copy can be a powerful tool for your business. It can help you to increase sales, improve customer engagement, drive website traffic, and build brand awareness. Good copywriting practices will increase the overall value of your website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph-->
<p>By now, you may have noticed that you&#8217;d typically get more reactions and engagements whenever you upload funny and less-salesy content versus when you post an advert of a product or your entire business.</p>
<p>The problem is not far-fetched; people hate advertisements. People are naturally inclined to avoid being sold something to. Fortunately, this problem can be largely solved through the use of Content Marketing.</p>
<h2>What is Content Marketing?</h2>
<p>Content Marketing is a type of inbound marketing strategy that involves the creation and sharing of online content (such as videos, blogs, and social media posts) that does not directly promote a brand/product/service but is intended to stimulate interest or desire towards such brand(s), product(s) or service(s).</p>
<p>Content marketing is <a href="https://branditechture.agency/">our</a> main marketing strategy here in <a href="https://branditechture.agency/">Branditechture</a>, and we thought it is a nice idea to share this one with our readers. One of the most popular content marketing strategies on social media is by posting educational content, then making &#8216;subtle attempts&#8217; to sell practical resources (such as e-books, blueprints, CD, products etc.) to assist the reader in achieving the set objectives discussed.</p>
<p>What more? Google loves content! Setting up a <a class="extlink" href="https://branditechture.com/blog-can-help-your-real-estate-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a> and posting original content would only help your website rank higher in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs), thereby helping you reach a wider audience.</p>
<h2>20 Brand Content Ideas For Your Content Marketing</h2>
<p>In this blog post, I will itemize 20 brand content ideas that will help you in your content creation process. I will try to sort them into categories as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>Educational</li>
<li>Inspirational</li>
<li>Community-focused</li>
<li>Trend-based</li>
<li>Promotional</li>
</ul>
<h2>Educational Content</h2>
<p>Educational content can help your brand build authority over the topics that matter most in your industry. The purpose of this type of content is to provide answers, solutions, and information to your audience. Aside from educating your audience, it also portrays you as an expert in the field, thereby making it easier for prospects to trust you.</p>
<h3>1. How-to Guides</h3>
<p>Creating how-to guides is a great way to showcase your experience in cases that your target audience is interested in. Guides can range from simple instructions for accomplishing small tasks or how to use a product, to fully detailed guides about important topics that are relevant to your niche. Do-it-yourself (DIY) guides are a popular example of <em>How-to content</em>.2. Lists List content, such as this post, is another way to effectively communicate informational content and itemize related information. List-oriented posts can help people keep track of everything that they need to know about the topic being discussed. Think of lists as a tool for delivering all available options on a certain topic — Not every item on the list is required to be accepted by the reader, but you definitely have all your options in one place.</p>
<h3>3. Tips and Insights</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s no denying the fact that we’ve all browsed the internet in need of some tips or advice before, and we&#8217;ll do that over and over again. Consumers are likely to trust brands that provide tips and insights that are crucial to their buying decisions. The more trust you can build, the more powerful your brand becomes. Offering tips and detailed insights is a surefire way to gain some reputation in your industry.</p>
<h3>4. Case Studies</h3>
<p>A case study is an in-depth and detailed analysis of a particular situation. It requires the writer to have reporting skills. A good case study must report what transpired behind the scene;</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial problem</li>
<li>The goal</li>
<li>Methodology</li>
<li>Challenges encountered</li>
<li>How the challenges were tackled</li>
<li>Final results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Delivering this type of insight to your audience is an excellent opportunity to prove your originality, knowledge and awareness. 
<h3>5. Tutorials</h3>
<p>A tutorial is another great example of how you can supply information that will solve some of the problems that your target audience often encounters. <em>Tutorial content </em>is similar to <em>How-to content</em> in so many ways, but the biggest difference between a How-to content and Tutorial content is that a <em><strong>Tutorial</strong></em> is commonly aimed at permanently imparting knowledge, while a <em><strong>how-to</strong></em> is more of a list of detailed steps to achieve a particular goal.</p>
<p>In summary;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tutorial: </strong>Interactive set of instructions to teach by example, with the ultimate goal of imparting or transferring knowledge in a certain area of expertise.</li>
<li><strong>How-to:</strong> Simplified and short description of how to accomplish some specific task meant to help non-experts. Here, the goal is not to impart knowledge but to help accomplish a specific task by providing (easy-to-follow) steps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Analytical Content</h3>
<p>The use of charts, diagrams, tables, and other frameworks are a great way to deliver an analytical type of content that organizes topics into contextual pieces of information.</p>
<p>The benefit here is that these frameworks are usually very engaging, and they may keep the attention of the consumer for a long time as they try to understand the idea behind it.</p>

<h2>Inspirational Content</h2>
<p>This is all about motivation and inspiration. Motivation is the driving force behind soldiers putting up their lives at the war front. Just like these soldiers, we all need those small nudges toward making the best from life, and this is where your brand can come in.</p>
<p>While educational content is there to inform your audience, inspirational content is more lighthearted, yet powerful — It’s there to inspire creativity and happiness.</p>
<h3>7. Ideas</h3>
<p>Inspire your audience by offering smart and creative suggestions that they can implement or adopt in order to add value to their lifestyle.</p>
<h3>8. Perspective-based or Opinion-based</h3>
<p>Creating content that gives your opinion on relevant topics shows how much you care. Take a stance on some important things that matter in the life of your audience. Be nice to them when they disagree with you or when they request to know more on the rationale behind your opinion.</p>
<h3>9. Stories</h3>
<p>Stories bring about a natural way for people to connect and reflect on. You can always find stories to tell your audience from;</p>
<ul>
<li>Your brand’s origin and past experiences</li>
<li>Inspiring stories about some of the people in your organization</li>
<li>Stories of how your brand made an impact on other people&#8217;s lives.</li>
<li>Stories of how your product helped people</li>
</ul>
<h3>10. Experiments (e.g A/B Tests)</h3>
<p>Experiments are interesting because you set the stage up for a surprise outcome. Surprises and uncertain outcomes keep us on our toes no matter what form they come in. Writing content focused on experiments is a great way to learn and grow together with your audience. 
<h2>Community-focused Content</h2>
<p>In the internet world, a <em>community</em> is a group of internet users sharing a common interest. (e.g Web Design, Entrepreneurship, SME, Food Lovers.) When you create relevant community-focused content, you develop a strong connection with your audience, such that they become more likely to follow you, share your updates, recommend to their friends, and so on. This type of content eventually allows you to grow a fanbase and build loyalty through direct interaction with people from varying communities.</p>
<h3>11. Events</h3>
<p>You can occasionally post content that is not directly related to your brand; for example, general events such as holidays. You can post a written report from seminars, workshops, live conferences, community events, and meetups for those people who did not have the opportunity to attend.</p>
<p>You can also publish images and live videos of your brand in action during related community events such as meetups, conference, workshops etc.</p>
<h3>12. Behind The Scene</h3>
<p>A lot goes on behind the scenes of a workplace every day, which means that there is a lot to draw from and share with your audience. Sharing <em><strong>behind the scene</strong></em> or <em><strong>work-in-progress</strong></em> content depicts some sort of transparency in your business culture and practices, which in turn would increase the trust that your consumers will place on your brand.</p>
<h3>13. Testimonials</h3>
<p>Testimonials are a very effective way of providing social proof to those who are in the &#8216;consideration phase&#8217; in their consumer journey. You can get materials for your testimonial-based content by;</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting reviews and success stories directly from consumers who are willing to share</li>
<li>Extracting them from places like comments and direct messages on social media.</li>
</ul>
<h3>14. Earned Content</h3>
<p><em>Earned content</em> refers to content that you gain through a third-party &#8216;publisher&#8217; (e.g., A review of your product by a Youtuber, published on Youtube). If you are lucky to get earned content, please, do not hesitate to share it with your audience.</p>
<h3>15. Interviews</h3>
<p>A lot of people love to hear conversations and debates on topics of interest. You can interview celebrities, clients or consumers, influencers in your community or anyone else that you think will bring value to your audience. 
<h2>Trend-based Content</h2>
<p>New things happen on the internet every single day. That alone can help you to always find a way to generate fresh ideas for your content. This type of content usually performs well while the trend is recent, and then the interest is lost over time. This is perfectly ok because not all content can be evergreen, but it will help you boost your reach for the moment being.</p>
<h3>16. News</h3>
<p>You may report breaking news and other happenings in your community. When reporting breaking news, always ensure that it is from a reliable source.</p>
<h3>17. Trends</h3>
<p>The internet has made it possible for all kinds of activities to go viral, and people love to explore different versions of the same trending topic. Content that revolves around current trends can be a fun way to participate in something that amuses your target audience at the moment. Trends tend to go away quickly, but trendy contents can boost your short-term reach.</p>
<h3>18. Reviews</h3>
<p>In today’s digital world, it’s a very common practice to browse the web for reviews and experiences reported by users of the things we want to purchase or use. Reviews and comparison-based content are a good way to give your two cents about things that your audience cares about. When posting comparison-based content, please be as neutral as possible so that your content doesn&#8217;t scream bias.</p>
<h2>Promotional Content</h2>
<p>Your content strategy also calls for the right amount of promotional content in the mix. You can use this type of content to bring attention to offers, products, or services that you offer.</p>
<h3>19. Sponsored Content</h3>
<p>A sponsored content is an all-paid-for placement of content that may contribute to the exposure of your brand. Sponsored content is an effective method of reaching a wider audience within a very short period of time. However, that does not mean that this type of content always has to be an obvious advertisement.  </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="515" height="536" class="wp-image-6630" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sponsored-Content-from-Google.png" alt="Content Ideas For Your Content Marketing; Sponsored Content from Google" title="20 Content-Generation Ideas for Your Brand&#039;s Marketing 2" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sponsored-Content-from-Google.png 515w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sponsored-Content-from-Google-288x300.png 288w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sponsored-Content-from-Google-480x500.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" />
<figcaption>A Sponsored Content from Google</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Remember, content full of value is a promotion in itself.</p>
<h3>20. Descriptive Content</h3>
<p>The idea behind this is to creatively describe a product, service etc., without the pressure of a sales page that indicates your intention is to convert them into a customer. When people are naturally attracted to your product or service organically, they will reach out by themselves.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Content marketing, if done correctly and consistently, will help you achieve your business goals by;</p>
<ul>
<li>Building brand awareness</li>
<li>Generating <strong><em>high-quality </em></strong>leads</li>
<li>Converting leads into loyal fans</li>
<li>Customer engagement and retention</li>
<li>Overall boosting of sales</li>
</ul>
<p>The level of importance that you give to each category depends on the type of brand that you run and your content strategy goals. Experiment with different types of high-quality content and use the feedback you receive to learn what works best for your audience.</p>
<p>With time, you will discover what they are looking for, and you will find your brand voice. <strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Use <a class="extlink" href="https://keyword.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-schema-attribute="">Keyword.io</a> for ideas on specific topics to write on</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that the majority of the data you consume today was created in the last two years? Within the next two years, roughly 1.7 megabytes of data will be generated for every human being on the planet every second. That&#8217;s fantastic news for content writers that use enormous volumes of data (known as Big Data) to create engaging content.</p>
<p>When your site&#8217;s traffic grows as a result of relevant content, new advertising opportunities open up. Content writers, in turn, contribute to this vast source of information.</p>
<h2>What is Big Data?</h2>
<p>Big Data is a large collection of data that is rapidly growing in volume. It&#8217;s a data set that&#8217;s so large and complex that no traditional data management tools can effectively store or process it. Big data is similar to regular data, except that it is much larger and keeps growing at an exponential pace.</p>
<h2>How does Big Data impact content writing?</h2>
<p>When Big Data presents the numbers, it&#8217;s very easy for content writers to get tempted to employ means with which can make the algorithms increase their impressions and click-through rates rather than creating amazing content that humans love to read (which increases traffic quality and boosts CTR).</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of any content writing campaign is to provide relevant and appealing information while advertising a product or service. But is it that simple? Unfortunately, the answer is No.</p>
<p>Original content is increasingly getting difficult to come by in the majority of cases, but in spite of that, Big Data can still help generate unique topics for content writing, and here is how;</p>
<h3>1. Comparing Stats Can Give Rise to New Information</h3>
<p>Big data refers to information that can be analysed.</p>
<p>For example, the online dating service <em>OKCupid.com</em> analysed five years of data to examine the relationship between race and attraction, as well as men and women&#8217;s dating preferences and how they have changed over time. The information was useful for further study, and it was a decent attempt to understand users&#8217; preferences.</p>
<p>Everything checks out in terms of content: it presented new (arguably intriguing) information, opened up new conversations on race preference in dating, and still allowed them to market their service.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Writing Content for A Website? Read These Golden Tips!&#8221; &#8212; Branditechture" src="https://branditechture.agency/writing-content-for-a-website-read-these-golden-tips/embed/#?secret=4maL0mG4xI#?secret=4ExBmXTMZM" data-secret="4ExBmXTMZM" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<h3>2. You can use Big Data to figure out which audiences to target with your content.</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;ve found your voice as a content writer, you may use demographics like age, gender, ethnicity, employment status, education, income, geography, and interests to segment your target audience. With this knowledge, the content you create functions as a two-way street for both you and the consumer.</p>
<p>You will be able to better understand and respond to your customers&#8217; demands, while your target consumers will be introduced to your products or services and will be more inclined to respond to you than if your articles were sent to just anyone.</p>
<h3>3. Big Data Assists in the Development of User Personas</h3>
<p>User personas are archetypal users whose aims and traits mirror and represent that of a larger group of people. A persona is usually given as a virtual user profile, with data like habits, interests behavioural patterns, goals, talents, attitudes, and other background information</p>
<p>Content Writers typically create user persona templates that include a few fictional personal details to make the persona a realistic character.</p>
<p>Large amounts of data may benefit your <a class="extlink" href="https://support.branditechture.agency/docs/seo-checklist-how-we-perform-seo-on-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site&#8217;s SEO</a>, but keep in mind that the material you provide isn&#8217;t for computers – it&#8217;s for humans.</p>
<p>You can utilise statistics to develop a profile of your target audience, and transforming data into a person can help you communicate more clearly with your audience.</p>
<h3>4. Big Data Analysis Leads to New Insights</h3>
<p>Writing content is difficult in and of itself, but it becomes even more difficult when you try to make it interactive for your viewers. Because data comes from three main sources on the internet (streaming, social media, and publically available sources), soliciting input or comment from your readers can help you gather additional data and perhaps spark new content ideas while staying true to your content marketing objectives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With over 3 billion monthly active users, Facebook and Twitter are two of the busiest social media platforms today. If done right, these two platforms can be turned into a formidable marketing tool for your business in this season 7 of the <em>Big Brother Naija</em> reality TV show titled <strong><em>&#8220;Level Up&#8221;</em></strong>. Facebook and Twitter present you with the opportunity to grow and showcase your <a href="https://branditechture.agency/personal-or-corporate-branding/">business or brand</a> in front of a very large audience, running into millions of ready-to-buy people.</p>
<p>As we all know, the Big Brother reality TV show always takes social media by storm and it is not so uncommon for you to see <em><strong>&#8220;#BBNaija&#8221;</strong></em> hashtags dominate social media platforms like Twitter. In the anticipation of the Big <em><strong>Brother Naija Season 7</strong></em>, this year&#8217;s edition of the popular TV show is tipped to be the biggest and most successful one ever.</p>
<p>However, amid the certain noise and buzz, here are <em><strong>proven</strong></em> tips to follow in order to take advantage of this year&#8217;s Big Brother Naija season 7 to grow your followers on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>1. Optimize Your Facebook And Twitter Page</h2>
<p>The first step is to make your Facebook or Twitter Profile aesthetically <a href="https://branditechture.agency/how-to-optimize-your-facebook-profile-for-quality-leads/">more appealing</a> to people for them to follow your page. This step is very important as there is no growth hack that will work if your profile page looks scanty or distasteful.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_16960" style="width: 617px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16960" class="size-full wp-image-16960" title="Example of a well done Twitter business page" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Example-of-a-well-done-Twitter-business-page.jpg" alt="Example of a well done Twitter business page" width="607" height="345" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Example-of-a-well-done-Twitter-business-page.jpg 607w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Example-of-a-well-done-Twitter-business-page-300x171.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Example-of-a-well-done-Twitter-business-page-480x273.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px" /><p id="caption-attachment-16960" class="wp-caption-text">Example of a well-done Twitter business page.</p></div></p>
<pre>We can help you design catchy social media banners and covers. Just place an order via <a href="https://branditechture.agency/start-a-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Get Started"><strong>this link</strong></a>, and we would be in touch with you within a few minutes.</pre>
<p>This page should have an attractive cover picture as well as a profile picture. You should also create a catchy description (called <em><strong>&#8220;Bio&#8221;</strong></em>) with brief information about what you want people to know and exactly what it is you have to offer them.</p>
<h2>2. Create Curated BB Naija Posts and Publish On Your Pages</h2>
<p>Posting a variety of <strong>curated</strong> BB Naija content and trends that resonate with your existing followers is a very great way to grow your social media following.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Posting trending <em><strong>but relevant</strong></em> Big Brother Naija topics will definitely keep your followers engaged and wanting more. Please note that not every Big Brother Naija content would be applicable to your brand, hence the emphasis on the word, <strong>&#8220;curate&#8221;. </strong></p>
<p>There are a ton of different formats for posting content. And these include pictures, GIFs, videos, Q&amp;As, and more.</p>
<p>You can experiment with different content formats to see which gets the best engagement rate from your followers. Don&#8217;t limit your creativity as there is nothing stopping you from combining different formats (<em>pictures + GIFs + videos combo</em>) when delivering content to your followers.</p>
<p>Another great tip is to keep your content fresh and updated always. If you want your followers to keep coming back to your account, you have to keep them interested. If you stop posting content for too long, followers will forget about you and find another account to follow to catch up with the latest news. That may sound harsh and unforgiving, but that&#8217;s just the reality these days.</p>
<h2>3. Sharing Your Social Media Post Across Active and Engaging Groups</h2>
<p>There are several active, engaging Big Brother Naija Groups out there on Facebook where you can share your content. When sharing your post across different groups, make sure to tailor the message for each audience. This will help you get the most engagement and reach the largest potential audience.</p>
<p>Be sure to include a call to action (such as <em>&#8220;Follow my page for more updates&#8221;</em>) in each post. This will encourage engagement and let your community know how they can connect with you.</p>
<h2>4. Use Trending BB Naija Hashtags</h2>
<p>Hashtags are one of the most effective ways to get your content to reach lots of people and generate more engagement for your social media profile, most especially on Twitter. The more hashtags you use, the more likely people will find your content when they search for those hashtags.</p>
<p>Choosing the right hashtags can be tricky, but there are some tools available to help you with hashtag research. For example, Twitter has a free hashtag research tool that shows trending topics and the most popular hashtags on Twitter based on popularity and engagement rate. You can then use this data to choose which hashtags to include in your post.</p>
<p>Using these tools will help you find popular hashtags that match up with the type of content you post so that it gets seen by as many people as possible.</p>
<h2>5. Post Content Featuring A Big Brother Naija Contestant In Focus</h2>
<p>The keyword here is <strong>&#8220;In Focus&#8221;.</strong> Posting content featuring a Big Brother Naija contestant in focus can blow up your account in a very short time and skyrocket your account engagement, especially if it is a fan&#8217;s favourite. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean you should turn your business page into a &#8220;stan account&#8221;. <em>Stan account</em> is a fancy word for &#8220;fan account&#8221;, which is an account dedicated to posting updates on only one contestant.</p>
<p>With that being said, You should focus on a different contestant at any given time.</p>
<p>A Big Brother Naija fan can&#8217;t resist the urge to check out a piece of news featuring any of the contestants when they are scrolling on social media, it always grabs their attention, and this is what makes a post that features a contestant go viral.</p>
<p>We have seen this in action several times as this tip has been used by several media companies such as <em>Legit.ng,</em> and <em>Zikoko!</em>, and its no doubt that all those posts get a ton of engagement.</p>
<h2>6. Employ Argumentative Content As Part Of Your Content Strategy</h2>
<p>This is especially important if you are trying to attract a new audience to your page. When you are creating content, think about how you can frame it as an argument for your readers.</p>
<p>Let us use a former Big Brother Naija housemate as an example: &#8220;<em>Pere</em> may be more charismatic than Laycon, but if you consider his poor communication skill, arrogance, and other non-pleasing behaviour, Laycon is still better than pere (This is just an example).</p>
<p>You can, therefore, make an argument for why someone should consider <em>Laycon</em> to <em>Pere</em>. This can spur attention from prospects who might otherwise not have shown interest in your business page or profile.</p>
<p>With argumentative content, you want to make sure that your readers know that they will be reading an essay-style piece that may challenge their current stand on a topic.</p>
<p>The last thing that you want to do is cause confrontation or tension among your readers, but you do want to spark a conversation and make sure that your readers know that they can expect to be challenged with this type of content.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Smart<a href="https://branditechture.agency/how-to-use-brand-clarity-to-improve-your-marketing-message/"> business people</a> have been using the Big Brother Naija TV show to grow their media following for a very long time now and all the tips I have shared above can certainly help you generate more followers for both your Facebook and Twitter profiles, even as a business.</p>
<p>Choosing a trend that is relevant to your company or industry can produce incredible results. And as we all know, that Big Brother Naija is all about trends. Once you have identified a promising trend, you will want to ensure that the content you are sharing is easy to understand and has click-worthy headlines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your small business needs to start blogging, but there&#8217;s a catch&#8230;</p>
<p>Doubt.</p>
<p>Yes, I have seen more than enough small businesses cast doubts over the marketing of their goods and services, and in most cases, this has to do with money. Well, this may be associated to the high cost of traditional advertising methods and the possibility of not breaking even.</p>
<p>You may have hired someone to assist with <a href="https://branditechture.agency/lets-build-your-website/">web design</a>, <a href="https://branditechture.agency/web-writing-best-practices/">copywriting</a>, and overall <a href="https://branditechture.agency/branding-packages/">branding</a> of your small business, but have you considered engaging a professional to create (and manage) a long-term SEO campaign for your small business website? Are you really prepared  to invest that much money?</p>
<p>I understand that traditional marketing is expensive, and if it&#8217;s done incorrectly, you might as well flush those dollars down the toilet.</p>
<p>So, what is the solution?</p>
<p>How can a small business like yours spread the message without taking on more financial risk than necessary?</p>
<p>How can a small business advertise while saving money?</p>
<p>By establishing a blog!</p>
<h2>Here are four strong reasons why your small business should start blogging right away&#8230;</h2>
<h3>1. You Will Be Found On Google Search Results</h3>
<p>Marcus Sheridan&#8217;s work for River Pools and Spas is something I would always admire.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with this story, he and his partners helped resurrect a company that had been severely hit by a financial crisis in 2008. You can read the full <a href="https://branditechture.com/how-a-swimming-pool-company-made-2-5-million-in-sales-from-a-single-article-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study</a> in detail <a href="https://branditechture.com/how-a-swimming-pool-company-made-2-5-million-in-sales-from-a-single-article-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into too much detail, but they began blogging by responding to client questions. The answers to those questions were turned into blogs based on honesty, detail, and long-tail keywords.</p>
<p>What exactly is Marcus Sheridan&#8217;s philosophy? &#8220;They inquire, and you respond.&#8221;</p>
<p>River Pools and Spas was not a new firm, but they were having trouble, and blogging helped them out! The company is booming, and the site now dominates the search result pages in their industry.</p>
<p>This is a blueprint you might follow, and it could be just what you need to get the search engine results you want.</p>
<p><strong>So let&#8217;s get started&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>a.) Familiarize yourself with long-tail keyword techniques.</p>
<p>b.) Look at your own business plan and start making keyword plans there.</p>
<p>c.) Conduct a positioning, <a href="https://branditechture.agency/top-6-factors-to-consider-when-naming-a-brand/">naming</a>, and tagline exercise. Even if you like your present name or slogan, you&#8217;ll be surprised at how many topic ideas you may come up with.</p>
<p>d.) Think about particular questions your ideal consumer may ask using the River Pools methodology.</p>
<p>e.) After that, make a post editorial calendar.</p>
<p>f.) If you&#8217;ve already started <a href="https://branditechture.agency/lets-build-your-website/">building your website</a>, ensure that it&#8217;s  built with <a href="https://branditechture.agency/why-wordpress-is-perfect-for-your-next-website-project/">WordPress</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>2. Blogging Acts as a Catalyst for All Other Marketing Activities</h3>
<p>Consider that for a moment. You have the beginnings of something extraordinary if you take the time to go through the procedures above and come up with 10 or 20 or 30 great blogs.</p>
<p>Have you heard of the word &#8220;repurposing&#8221;?</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s say one of your blog posts is titled &#8220;7 Top Trends in (your industry) That Your Business Should Pay Attention To.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>With the above titled post, you&#8217;re not precisely pitching your business (which is fine), but you are commanding some authority in your industry by simply recognizing trends that potential customers should and will be interested in&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Blogging is a fantastic driver for smart marketing! It&#8217;s just imperative that you get started.</p>
<h3>3. Blogging Can Help Bring Your Brand Into Limelight</h3>
<p>As more relevant content gets added to your website, Google, as well as your potential clients, start to notice you more often.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve already taken the time to define your brand, blogging will help you polish it even further. The iterative nature of the process makes this unavoidable, and believe me, this is a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Why is that&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>a.) Your brand is always evolving. You may have positioned your goods or services expertly, but the more you write, the more refined you&#8217;ll get, like a potter spinning clay into a lovely vase.</p>
<p>Spinning it. Working on it. Refining it.</p>
<p>Blogging keeps the process running, which is fantastic in a number of ways.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s similar to creative juice for your business. Your website is the mixer, and each new post is a fantastic addition to the mix.</p>
<p>b.) Your product is seen by your ideal consumer (in a different light than your competitors). Even if you and your competitors are both offering the same service, you&#8217;d edge them out with a blog. And if at all they do have a blog too, you can certainly gain more visibility by posting relevant SEO content more often.</p>
<p>Get to work while your competitors eat your dust. (They&#8217;re the slackers who don&#8217;t grasp it.)</p>
<h3>4. It&#8217;s the Most Effective Way to Find Brand Evangelists</h3>
<p>Customers are &#8220;emotionally moved&#8221; by brands like Apple in a variety of ways, thanks to their <a href="https://branditechture.agency/7-secrets-to-building-and-sustaining-brand-equity/">brand equity</a>.</p>
<p>Many successful small and medium-sized businesses follow suit&#8230; They try to figure out how consumers think, research, and buy things, and then build a brand experience around that. This creates a fervent fan following that <a href="https://branditechture.agency/8-proven-ways-to-market-your-business/">promotes</a> the brand aggressively — a phenomenon known as brand evangelism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Material marketing is the art of generating relevant and interesting content in a consistent fashion to a targeted customer, focusing on all stages of the buying process, from brand recognition through to brand evangelism,&#8221; says Joe Pulizzi, founder of the Content Marketing Institute.</p>
<p>That is unarguable.</p>
<p>Blogging is an example of <a href="https://branditechture.agency/generate-content-for-your-brand/">content marketing.</a> If done correctly, you may find that more than a few people are eager to tell the world about what you have to offer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There you have it &#8211; four solid reasons for your small business to blog.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to get to work!</p>
