										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of digital marketing is complex, and SaaS companies need a strong online presence to compete. Search engine optimization (SEO) is essential to drive traffic and expand your customer base. Handling SEO internally can be time-consuming and requires constant learning.  By outsourcing to an experienced SEO expert, you gain valuable time and tap into specialized knowledge. At Profit By PPC, we offer customized <a href="https://profitbyppc.com/digital-marketing-consultant" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>digital marketing consulting</b></a> and PPC solutions for ambitious SaaS companies.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s discuss how partnering with an SEO specialist can propel your SaaS business forward.</p>
<h2><b>1. Deep Understanding of SaaS-Specific SEO</b></h2>
<p>The world of SaaS (software-as-a-service) comes with unique SEO challenges and opportunities. Search engines evaluate SaaS websites through a different lens compared to traditional business or e-commerce sites. An expert <b>SEO consultant for SAAS Company</b> has honed their skills within this specific domain. They possess the intricate knowledge to craft strategies tailored to your industry, ensuring your website&#8217;s content and structure align perfectly with how potential customers search for your type of solution.</p>
<h2><b>2. Expertise in Technical SEO</b></h2>
<p>Technical SEO forms the bedrock of a high-ranking website. Seemingly small errors like broken links, slow loading speeds, or indexing issues can significantly impede your visibility in search results. An SEO consultant conducts a comprehensive technical audit, pinpointing these potential roadblocks and fixing them. This attention to detail ensures that search engine crawlers can easily understand and index your website effectively, leading to improved rankings.</p>
<h2><b>3. Effective Keyword Research</b></h2>
<p>Identifying the right keywords is like finding the hidden treasure map to SEO success. An SEO consultant understands your target audience deeply. They&#8217;ll delve into their pain points, their needs, and, most importantly, the words and phrases they use to search for solutions like yours. This research forms the basis of your content strategy and marketing campaigns, ensuring you&#8217;re strategically targeting those high-value keywords.</p>
<h2><b>4. High-Quality Content Creation</b></h2>
<p>Content is truly king in the SEO world, but not just any content. An SEO expert understands the delicate balance between search intent and valuable, informative content. They can collaborate with your team to develop blog posts, product pages, landing pages, and thought-leadership articles that resonate with your audience. This high-quality, keyword-optimised content builds trust, establishes authority, and draws in the right visitors.</p>
<h2><b>5. Optimised On-Page SEO</b></h2>
<p>Beyond your website&#8217;s content, numerous on-page factors affect your search engine rankings. A skilled SEO consultant pays meticulous attention to elements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Meta Titles and Descriptions</b>: These snippets of text displayed in search results need to be compelling and keyword-rich to entice clicks.</li>
<li><b>Header Tags</b>: Proper structure (H1, H2, etc.) helps search engines understand the hierarchy of your content.</li>
<li><b>Image Optimisation:</b> Alt-text and file sizes play a role in how images are indexed and contribute to page load speed.</li>
<li><b>Internal Linking:</b> A well-structured internal linking strategy distributes authority throughout your site, improving navigation for both visitors and search engines.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>6. Link-Building Strategies</b></h2>
<p>Link building, also known as backlinking, involves acquiring high-quality links to your website from other reputable sources. Search engines view these links as endorsements of your content, boosting your authority and trustworthiness. An SEO consultant won&#8217;t rely on spammy tactics but will develop legitimate link-building campaigns aligned with your niche. The result is a stronger backlink profile and an upward trajectory in search rankings.</p>
<h2><b>7. Competitive Analysis</b></h2>
<p>Gaining an edge in a competitive market requires knowing your rivals&#8217; moves. An experienced SEO consultant dissects your competitors&#8217; online presence, uncovering their strengths, weaknesses, and areas where you can outsmart them. Armed with these insights, we&#8217;ll develop SEO tactics that put you ahead of the pack.</p>
<h2><b>8. Local SEO</b></h2>
<p>SaaS businesses often serve clients across the globe. However, if your customer base is concentrated in a particular location or region, local SEO is essential. An SEO consultant helps you rank prominently in &#8220;near me&#8221; searches, driving leads from your geographic area. Tactics include optimising your Google My Business listing and targeting locally relevant keywords.</p>
<h2><b>9. Data-Driven Insights</b></h2>
<p>SEO isn&#8217;t a set-it-and-forget-it activity. Success depends on continuous analysis and improvement. An expert consultant leverages analytics tools to track an array of metrics, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Search Rankings</b>: Monitoring Your Position for Essential Keywords</li>
<li><b>Website Traffic</b>: Understanding Traffic Sources and Visitor Demographics</li>
<li><b>Conversions</b>: tracking leads, trials, and subscriptions generated from organic search</li>
<li><b>Bounce Rate</b>: Identifying pages that need optimisation to retain visitors</li>
</ul>
<p>These data-driven insights illuminate what&#8217;s working and what needs adjustment, allowing us to refine your SEO strategy for maximum impact.</p>
<h2><b>10. Saves You Time and Money</b></h2>
<p>Building a robust internal SEO team is a costly endeavour.  Hiring a dedicated SEO expert, plus investing in necessary tools and subscriptions, quickly adds up. Partnering with a skilled SEO consultant for SaaS companies offers several financial benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Specialised Expertise</b>: You gain immediate access to proven knowledge and strategies without the expense of hiring and training in-house.</li>
<li><b>Scalability</b>: <a href="https://profitbyppc.com/seo-services-for-saas-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>SEO services for SaaS Company</b></a> can scale alongside your business growth without the need to expand your payroll.</li>
<li><b>Focused Investment</b>: Your budget is directed towards results-driven strategies, avoiding inefficient spending on tactics that don&#8217;t deliver.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sky is truly the the limit as a British Airways advertising campaign from 2013 showed us. The ad campaigned titled &#8220;<strong>#lookup</strong>&#8220;, which was created by the popular marketing agency, OgilvyOne, stretched the boundaries of billboard advertising by combining old and new techniques to give the world something <span>unprecedented</span>.</p>
<h2>The Concept Behind the Amazing British Airways Billboard</h2>
<p>British Airways is the largest airline in the United Kingdom in terms of fleet size, route network, and revenue. However, the sector is fiercely competitive, and the company continues to strive for new heights with its advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>As a result, two digital billboards were created in London. These particular placards were placed between the public&#8217;s view and the flight paths of planes arriving and departing from Heathrow Airport. The display was upgraded with advanced technology that could follow planes as they flew overhead, and that&#8217;s when the magic began.</p>
<p>A video of a toddler pointing at an airplane and running after it would begin to play. The sign would also display the flight number and location from whence the plane took off, before returning to a very basic British Airways display.</p>
<div style="width: 940px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-13939-1" width="940" height="529" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-british-airline-billboard-in-london-where-a-kid-points-to-airplane-SD.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-british-airline-billboard-in-london-where-a-kid-points-to-airplane-SD.mp4">https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-british-airline-billboard-in-london-where-a-kid-points-to-airplane-SD.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Inspired the British Airways Billboard Design?</h2>
<div id="attachment_13942" style="width: 1035px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13942" class="size-full wp-image-13942" title="British Airways Billboard boy tracking airplane" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/British-Airways-Billboard-boy-tracking-airplane.jpg" alt="British Airways Billboard boy tracking airplane" width="1025" height="683" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/British-Airways-Billboard-boy-tracking-airplane.jpg 1025w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/British-Airways-Billboard-boy-tracking-airplane-300x200.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/British-Airways-Billboard-boy-tracking-airplane-768x512.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/British-Airways-Billboard-boy-tracking-airplane-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px" /><p id="caption-attachment-13942" class="wp-caption-text">British Airways Billboard showing boy tracking an airplane and displaying real time flight details.</p></div>
<p>British Airways went into the campaign with a few major objectives, one of which was to remind customers of the airline&#8217;s many global destinations. They also wanted to highlight some newer destinations in the hopes of encouraging customers to visit the British Airways website and book a flight.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this wasn&#8217;t a simple hashtag-advertising effort. It was all based on a strategy that would allow customers to <a href="https://branditechture.agency/7-secrets-to-building-and-sustaining-brand-equity/">engage emotionally</a> with the brand. People often imagine themselves on their way to an exotic area when they look up at planes in the sky, and this billboard managed to bring back those childhood memories for everyone who saw it. The use of a child allowed viewers to connect with their feelings of being awestruck by flight as a child, while also avoiding all the disappointment caused by misplaced luggage and extended delays.</p>
<h2>The Technology Behind the British Airways Billboard</h2>
<p>The billboard used a surveillance system that was particularly created for this campaign to ensure that it tracked real planes and that the video was timed with the planes as they flew by.</p>
<p>It employed a specific antenna that could register the transponders of all aircraft within a specified radius to figure out which plane it was. Many more aspects were taken into account throughout the programming. For example, it considered the plane&#8217;s height, the sky&#8217;s cloud cover, and the light (or lack thereof) to guarantee that people could see what they were supposed to see.</p>
<h2>How the Internet Responded to the British Airways Billboard</h2>
<p>The campaign&#8217;s own website, ba.com/lookup (which now redirects to britishairways.com/lookup), was established exclusively for it. It was created to make it simple for clients to transform their desires into bookings, allowing them to spend more time packing their belongings. It seems to be effective, as it received over <strong>43,300 unique visitors.</strong></p>
<p>The sign&#8217;s video has been viewed over 1.3 million times online, and the campaign has received over 45 million social media impressions. The hashtag <strong>#Lookup</strong> was put beneath the video and was used over 3,400 times on Twitter.</p>

<h2>Also Approved by the Advertising World</h2>
<p>The Ogilvy 12th Floor agency created the entire campaign, which was a huge success. The campaign won the Direct Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Similar ideas have been explored before in other parts of the world, but this was the first of its sort in the UK.</p>
<h2>The British Airways Billboard Uses a Combination of Digital and Traditional Marketing</h2>
<p>One of the most important lessons to learn from this campaign is that technological advancements do not always have to imply the demise of more traditional types of advertising. Print advertisements may appear to be less relevant than online ads that keep buyers one click away from making a purchase, but digital developments can bring certain platforms full circle. In a world of clickable computer code, a massive video could be exactly what you need to stand out.</p>
<h2>The Effects of Outdoor Advertising on Other Businesses</h2>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re not an airline firm, there&#8217;s always a method to use outdoor advertising to promote your brand using modern technologies. If you need help with getting your brand on a billboard, <a href="https://branditechture.agency/contact/">get in touch with us</a>, but first make sure your seat and tray table are fully upright and latched!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The colours you choose for your advertisement are more essential than the ad&#8217;s actual content. The reason for this is that the colours (and pictures) attract the attention of the consumer, causing them to read your advertisement. According to the website <a href="https://verywellmind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">verywellmind.com</a>, &#8220;Color impression, according to psychologists, can account for 60% of the acceptance or rejection of a product or service.&#8221;</p>
<p>To many cultures, each colour has a particular meaning. It&#8217;s critical to create your commercials in a way that appeals to your target demographic when it comes to advertising. Make an effort to select colours that complement the message you&#8217;re giving to your customers.</p>
<h2>Red</h2>
<p><a href="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/weorgq0jum.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-14284" title="weorgqjum" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/weorgq0jum.jpg" alt="Youtube" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/weorgq0jum.jpg 1600w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/weorgq0jum-300x169.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/weorgq0jum-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/weorgq0jum-768x432.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/weorgq0jum-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/weorgq0jum-480x270.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/weorgq0jum-1320x743.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Action, warmth, power, aggression, excitement, drama, fire, blood, passion, love, danger, rage, and heat are all associated with the colour red. It&#8217;s a bright, eye-catching colour that will always draw attention. Red will also elicit a range of feelings.</p>
<p>Stop signs have taught us to come to a complete stop when we see red. So it&#8217;s only logical that you&#8217;d want to pull over and take a look at a bright red billboard.</p>
<p>People at casinos wager more in red rooms than in any other colour, according to studies. Automobile dealerships, pet stores, pasta shops, pizzerias, and restaurants all benefit from the use of red.</p>
<p>The colour red, on the other hand, is not suggested for medical firms because it denotes ill health, blood, and emergency. Accountants use the colour red to signal that they have a negative cash flow.</p>
<h2>Orange</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-14281" title="orange banana beach-printed umbrella" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/afgux4-qvp4.jpg" alt="orange banana beach-printed umbrella" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/afgux4-qvp4.jpg 1600w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/afgux4-qvp4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/afgux4-qvp4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/afgux4-qvp4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/afgux4-qvp4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/afgux4-qvp4-480x320.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/afgux4-qvp4-1320x880.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p>Orange is a lively and enjoyable colour. It enhances mental clarity and generates feelings of warmth and contentment. Orange also improves the flow of oxygen to the brain. Orange is also related to feelings of contentment, fruitfulness, and wholesomeness.</p>
<p>The colour orange can make a high-priced item appear more affordable. It&#8217;s the ideal colour for things that appeal to a broad audience.</p>
<p>Orange is a stimulant of the appetite. Vitamin stores, Mexican restaurants, dancing clubs, and products aimed at Latin and French people should use this colour.</p>
<h2>Yellow</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-14289" title="white and yellow Shell wooden signage" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/w0vqkewa8ua.jpg" alt="white and yellow Shell wooden signage" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/w0vqkewa8ua.jpg 1600w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/w0vqkewa8ua-300x169.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/w0vqkewa8ua-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/w0vqkewa8ua-768x432.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/w0vqkewa8ua-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/w0vqkewa8ua-480x270.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/w0vqkewa8ua-1320x743.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p>Yellow is an ideal colour for advertising that is sunny, pleasant, bright, cheerful, lively, energetic, and optimistic. Florists, candy shops, toy stores, amusement parks, and discount retailers will all benefit from this choice.</p>
<p>The eye processes yellow as the first colour. It is also the colour that the human eye sees the most. This is why it attracts the eye more quickly than any other colour.</p>
<p>Yellow is also a cautionary colour. The majority of yellow road signs alert drivers to a problem on the road or in oncoming vehicles. Another reason why yellow attracts our attention is because it is bright.</p>
<h2>Green</h2>

<p>Life, nature, the environment, youth, money, renewal, hope, and power are all represented by the colour green. It&#8217;s a colour that relaxes individuals, relieves discomfort, and gives us a sense of security.</p>
<p>We feel welcomed since green traffic lights have conditioned us to move forward or enter places. This is a fantastic feature to have in any product or service.</p>
<p>Because yellow-green is an appetite suppressant, it is not a good colour for food marketing.</p>
<p>People are soothed by light green. That&#8217;s why light green walls can be found in jails, schools, waiting rooms, and hospitals.</p>
<p>Because it denotes money, green is a wonderful colour for financial counsellors, banks, and accountants. It&#8217;s also useful for outdoor products because it provides them with a sense of being outside in nature. Because green symbolises life, it can be utilised for greenhouses, vegetable stands, landscaping, and farmers.</p>
<h2>Blue</h2>
<p><a href="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jxscmh_1gm4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-14283" title="Facebook Blue" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jxscmh_1gm4.jpg" alt="Facebook Blue" width="1600" height="1200" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jxscmh_1gm4.jpg 1600w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jxscmh_1gm4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jxscmh_1gm4-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jxscmh_1gm4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jxscmh_1gm4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jxscmh_1gm4-480x360.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jxscmh_1gm4-1320x990.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>People associate blue with feelings of calm, relaxation, tranquilly, peace, wisdom, loyalty, and trustworthiness. It assists people in accepting themselves and resolving their issues.</p>
<p>The colour blue can also help you work more efficiently.</p>
<p>Blue, on the other side, can also represent sadness and depression. Because most foods are not blue, the colour blue acts as an appetite suppressant and can aid weight loss!</p>
<p>Blue is the most favoured colour among men and women alike. Blue is used in the logos of a number of well-known companies. Travel agencies, pool companies, masseurs, physicians&#8217; offices, pharmacies, medical suppliers, motels, psychologists, and weight reduction facilities all benefit from this colour.</p>
<h2>Purple</h2>
<p><a href="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a_iqo9thk1o.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-14288" title="Fedex white, orange and purplepassenger plane on airport during daytime" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a_iqo9thk1o.jpg" alt="Fedex white, orange and purplepassenger plane on airport during daytime" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a_iqo9thk1o.jpg 1600w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a_iqo9thk1o-300x200.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a_iqo9thk1o-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a_iqo9thk1o-768x512.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a_iqo9thk1o-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a_iqo9thk1o-480x320.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a_iqo9thk1o-1320x880.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Purple is a colour that exudes sophistication, creativity, luxury, and richness. It&#8217;s also linked to aristocracy. Purple in a bluish tint creates mystery, whereas purple in a reddish shade is sensual and creative. Combining purple with a reddish colour will definitely attract more attention.</p>
<p>Purple can be difficult to see for certain people (often men). Artists, elaborate restaurants, clothes stores, book stores, art galleries, nightclubs, magicians, photographers, country clubs, golf courses, jewellery stores, beauticians, and fortune-tellers will all benefit from this colour.</p>
<h2>Brown</h2>
<p><a href="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1hm2h47xb9y.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-14286" title="HD Brown Body cream" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1hm2h47xb9y.jpg" alt="HD Brown Body cream" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1hm2h47xb9y.jpg 1600w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1hm2h47xb9y-300x200.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1hm2h47xb9y-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1hm2h47xb9y-768x512.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1hm2h47xb9y-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1hm2h47xb9y-480x320.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1hm2h47xb9y-1320x880.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Brown is associated with coffee, lumber, and earth tones. It&#8217;s a colour that&#8217;s dependable, substantial, strong, mature, and comfy. Brown is currently seen as a rich and robust colour.</p>
<p>Hardware stores, coffee shops, craft shops, herbal shops, health food stores, male haberdasheries, cabinet shops, western stores, contractors, clock shops, and carpenters all benefit from the colour brown.</p>
<h2>Black</h2>
<p><a href="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/d4jrahauaic.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-14287" title="women's sunglasses and black bag with watch and iPhone 6" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/d4jrahauaic.jpg" alt="women's sunglasses and black bag with watch and iPhone 6" width="960" height="1200" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/d4jrahauaic.jpg 960w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/d4jrahauaic-240x300.jpg 240w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/d4jrahauaic-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/d4jrahauaic-768x960.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/d4jrahauaic-480x600.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<p>Power, prestige, elegance, style, dependability, simplicity, and sophistication are all represented by the colour black. It&#8217;s more about attitude than anything else when it comes to the colour black. Black is a fashionable colour that keeps customers current with technology. Little wonder why almost all the fashion brands use black. It&#8217;s also a highly educational colour.</p>
<p>Black was once associated with death, witches, demons, and evil. This perception, however, is changing today.</p>
<p>Music stores, accountants, lawyers, technology stores, and tyre stores all look amazing in black.</p>

<h2>White</h2>
<p>Purity, cleanliness, virtue, innocence, and freshness are all represented by the colour white.</p>
<p>Bridal shops, weddings, religious groups, daycare centres, medical institutions, wineries, dentists, catering firms, bakeries, museums, historical sites, bed and bath stores, dry cleaners, and cleaning services all benefit from the colour white.</p>
<p>Please be mindful of the fact that white is a colour associated with death and mourning in China, Japan, and other Middle Eastern countries.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve decided on the perfect colour (s) for your company, make sure to research which colours work well together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s article, we shall dig deep into the history of TV Advertising, as we look to uncover some of the events that unfolded prior to the modern adoption of TV as an advertising medium.</p>
<h2>It All Started With Radio</h2>
<div id="attachment_14270" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14270" class="size-full wp-image-14270" title="px Old radio Winschoten" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1024px-Old_radio-_Winschoten_2019.jpg" alt="px Old radio Winschoten" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1024px-Old_radio-_Winschoten_2019.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1024px-Old_radio-_Winschoten_2019-300x169.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1024px-Old_radio-_Winschoten_2019-768x432.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1024px-Old_radio-_Winschoten_2019-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-14270" class="wp-caption-text">Old radio, Winschoten.  Image Credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Donald_Trung" title="User:Donald Trung" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trung Quoc Don (Chữ Hán: 徵國單)</a><span> </span></p></div>
<p>Broadcasting began as a way for businesses to market themselves via radio messages. However, as commercial entities learned that many homes spent a large amount of time each day listening to their radios, they began to investigate this medium as a means of communicating with the general public.</p>
<p>The radio program broadcast by station WEAF in New York City on August 28, 1922, is considered the single event that started the age of radio transmission. This was a ten-minute commercial selling apartment accommodation in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Several large New York department stores had joined the fray by Christmas that year and were running advertisements for their stores.</p>
<p>Radio advertising had improved dramatically by the late 1920s. Advertising companies had now taken control of the schedules by purchasing available air time and selling it to their clients.</p>
<p>They were also in charge of the creative components of the ads and programs, and they even devised entire series aimed at selling one or more products. These initiatives laid the foundation for the birth of television advertising, which would come a few decades later.</p>
<h2>The Single Sponsor Era</h2>
<p>Because the United States took so long to recover from the Great Depression and World War II, full-time telecasting didn&#8217;t fully take off until 1948. At the time, the number of television sets had achieved the critical mass required to be declared a mass-media medium.</p>
<p>Also because television was a brand-new phenomenon, featuring both sound and moving pictures, the advertising business approached it with caution, unsure of the best ways to market their clients&#8217; products on television.</p>
<p>To put it another way, should it be handled like radio advertising with visuals thrown in, or should a completely new method be used to reach television consumers in a meaningful and effective way?</p>
<p>Following a series of research and several surveys, advertising agencies determined that developing shows that emphasized a single product or a line of items from a single company was the most successful approach to reach people with a compelling message.</p>
<div id="attachment_14271" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14271" class="size-full wp-image-14271" title="EddieFisherCokeTime" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EddieFisherCokeTime.jpg" alt="EddieFisherCokeTime" width="625" height="441" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EddieFisherCokeTime.jpg 625w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EddieFisherCokeTime-300x212.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EddieFisherCokeTime-480x339.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /><p id="caption-attachment-14271" class="wp-caption-text"><span>Still/screenshot from the popular NBC-TV series &#8220;Coke Time with Eddie Fisher&#8221; in 1954</span></p></div>
<p>The usual television shows of the 1950s arose from this model, including Kraft Television Theater, Colgate Comedy Hour, and Coke Time. These television programs, like radio, were created by advertising agencies for their clients rather than studios, as is today the case.</p>
<p>For a while, this method worked wonders for the clientele. However, as television grew in popularity and more people watched it, television networks raised their costs of doing business (i.e. more eyeballs = more dollars spent to reach them all), and this upward pressure on the cost of delivering a production over television (plus the ever-increasing costs of creating new content) forced a massive change in the relationship of all parties: advertising agencies, clients/sponsors, and the networks themselves.</p>
<p>If this very efficient advertising medium had to remain cost-effective for the sponsors, a solution had to be found.</p>
<h2>The Era of Magazine Concept Advertising</h2>
<p>Sylvester L. &#8220;Pat&#8221; Weaver, an NBC executive at that time, devised a method that would work and be beneficial to the networks. He pioneered television advertising&#8217;s &#8220;magazine concept.&#8221; Sponsors would buy blocks of time (usually one to two minutes) in a program rather than sponsoring the full show in this arrangement.</p>
<p>This concept would allow for a variety of sponsors &#8211; up to four in total &#8211; for an event. The networks would now have authority over the content, similar to a magazine because no single advertiser would &#8220;own&#8221; a specific show.</p>
<p>Madison Avenue, like all new ideas, initially resisted this one, but after some trial and error, they discovered that this method would work very well for a variety of packaged-goods companies producing a cornucopia of brand names, such as Procter and Gamble, which manufactures such disparate products as Tide (laundry detergent), Crest (toothpaste), and Jif (jam) (peanut butter).</p>
<p>The magazine concept had dominated television advertising by 1960, and it has continued to do so ever since. Sponsors now disperse their messages around the schedule to reach as many consumers as possible, rather than relying on audience identification with a specific show. The sponsors&#8217; ability to spread their advertising funds around to reach a larger portion of the public proved to be quite beneficial.</p>
<p>They could now choose the hours and networks where they wanted their message to be seen, rather than being bound into a single time slot every day or week on a specific network.</p>
<p>The birth of most current television advertising may be traced back to the emergence of magazine idea advertising. The infomercial is the one exception, as it is a throwback to the sponsored show concept that was popular in the early days of television advertising.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe title="Liquid Death Flavors vs. The Most Expensive Beverages on Earth" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WwoeO73tVNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Liquid Death<span>™</span> is a canned-water beverage founded by Mike Cessario. The product is manufactured by a company called <strong>Supplying Demand, Inc.</strong> Liquid Death&#8217;s tagline is <em><strong>&#8220;murder your thirst&#8221;.</strong></em></p>
<p>The drink is sold in a 16.9 US fl oz (500 ml) can otherwise known as <em>&#8220;tallboy&#8221;</em> (Refer to the video above). The water used to make Liquid Death is sourced from the Austrian Alps. The drink first sold in January 2019.</p>
<p>In a new video featuring the popular blind test game, Liquid Death pits its new flavored sparkling waters against some of the most expensive liquids in this world.</p>
<p>Liquid Death has made yet another pun out of marketing in the blind test game which was published yesterday. Back in April, it starred adult film star Cherie Deville in an ad campaign titled <em><strong>‘Don’t f*** the planet.’ </strong></em> The company is remarkably known for making fun of traditional marketing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;People like entertainment, but hate ads&#8221;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a comment made by Mike Cessario, co-founder and chief executive of Liquid Death Mountain Water.</p>
<p>The brand blindfolded 17 real people and asked them to compare its new flavored sparkling waters with some of the most expensive liquids on the planet.</p>
<p>The new sparkling water flavors – <strong><em>Berry It Alive</em></strong>, <strong><em>Mango Chainsaw</em></strong> and <em><strong>Severed Lime</strong> </em>– are all naturally sweetened with <a class="extlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agave" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agave</a>, with a recommended retail price of $1.99.</p>
<p>In a video which launched yesterday, the majority of the tasters appear to love the new flavors. A tallboy of Lobster Béarnaise Sauce ($50), on the other hand, is met with a clearly different reaction. Same with the liquified <a class="extlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beluga_caviar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Beluga caviar</em></a> ($580). Apparently, a person holding a bucket is on standby should in case a taster needs to puke.“You need the bucket?” asks the person offering the samples.</p>
<p>“We thought, ‘how do we talk about taste in a way that’s funny?’” says Mike Cessario, Liquid Death chief executive and co-founder. “Any time we make fun of the marketing tropes, that people are just so tired of, it tends to work pretty well. So we said let’s test Liquid Death against the most expensive stuff we can possibly think of &#8230; We’re trying to raise the bar in terms of making people laugh.”</p>
<p>The taste test launched yesterday, along with a message encouraging people to blindfold their closest friends and conduct their own taste tests. The goal is to get <em>Liquid Death</em> fans to post videos on their various <a href="https://branditechture.agency/you-dont-need-a-huge-following/">social media platforms.</a></p>
<p>“It could be something that people on TikTok, or social, would want to do to f*** with their friends,” says Cessario. “But you can’t force it or push too hard. It just has to become one of those things. But you always have to put stuff out there that feels like it has potential.”</p>

<p>The Liquid Death’s taste test is the first to involve imported <a class="extlink" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/squid-ink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">squid ink</a> ($58).</p>
<p>You should expect more activity from Liquid Death&#8217;s celebrity ambassadors, which include Travis Barker, Metallica, Steve O from Jackass, Wiz Khalifa, and comedian Bert Kreischer.</p>
<p>Steve O is a big fan of Liquid Death and you can see that from the brand tattoo on his neck, meanwhile, Tony Hawk, a professional skateboarder gave 100 vials of<a href="https://branditechture.agency/lessons-to-learn-from-lil-nas-xs-satan-shoes-saga/"> blood to be used for limited-edition</a> skateboard decks in a partnership with Liquid Death Mountain Water.</p>
<p>“We’ll continue to find fun ways to work with our ambassadors,” says Cessario. “We’re always going to push this <a href="https://branditechture.agency/8-ways-your-small-business-can-benefit-from-branding/">brand in a PG-13 way</a>. We’re always thinking about being more like Saturday Night Live and less like a commercial.”</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your take after watching this ad? Did you find the blind taste test funny or disgusting? Let&#8217;s know in the comment section below! 😀</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dutch brewing company, Heineken N.V. addresses the growing trend of work-life imbalance with a comical bottle opener in a new global campaign titled<em> &#8220;The Closer&#8221;. </em></strong></p>
<p>In a new campaign, Heineken and its creative communications partner Publicis Worldwide address the issue of work-life balance by featuring a high-tech bottle opener that promptly shuts down all work applications and devices when a bottle of beer is opened with it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heineken | The Closer" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cP3JRx4p9BQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The campaign titled <em><strong>&#8216;The Closer&#8217;</strong></em> addresses the increasing demands of the &#8217;24/7&#8242; work culture that has emerged in recent years. The 24/7 or &#8220;always-on&#8221; work culture has become even more prevalent as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its effects on the affected working population seem to be permanent.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a brand, we have always stood for creating moments with others,&#8221; said Bram Westenbrink, global head at Heineken.</p>
<p>He continued; “With the once-rigid boundaries between work and personal time rapidly deteriorating following the Covid-19 pandemic, we want to spark a much-needed conversation about the importance of resisting the societal pressures to be in a constant state of busywork, and encourage workers around the world to reprioritize social and leisure time with the people who matter most.”</p>
<p>To mark the latest campaign, Heineken has invited actor and comedian Billy Eichner to speak at the exclusive launch event evocative of iconic tech announcements.</p>
<p>“As people continue to feel like they have to work all the time, they’re forgetting that disconnecting is even an option,” said Bruno Bertelli, the global Chief Creative Officer of Publicis Worldwide.</p>
<p>“That’s why we created ‘The Closer.’ It’s not just technology; it’s a social provocation to help people see that the pressure to work all the time is getting a little ridiculous and we all have the power to log off and go hang out with our friends again.”</p>
<p>In a final effort, Heineken is encouraging employees in the United States to use a <em>Calendar Closer</em> at the end of the day to prevent colleagues from scheduling meetings after working hours. People that are first to use the Calendar Closer will be rewarded with money to spend on social activities with their friends and family.</p>
