wow wow chill bro lol some people just like saying dumb things on the internet. Don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s just a troll. That was a pretty smart catch you just did. I used to open the file on other softwares and just convert it to svg. But using a online converter and making a PDF I&#039;ve never thought about. Very cool. I&#039;ve been using corel draw for more than 15 years now and that&#039;s a really really annoying problem. Every long time user knows that corel draw its a pretty crapy option to handle &quot;complex vectors&quot; and stuff made on other softwares, and if you trying to do this, be prepared to get frustrated, but I love how fast and simple it is for some simple things like logos and icons. Thanks for the tip!]]></description>

I don&#039;t quite understand the need for this comment of yours, but this is currently the best and most efficient workaround for the CorelDRAW SVG issue. If you have a quicker method (which I highly doubt you do), then please share. Thanks.]]></description>
