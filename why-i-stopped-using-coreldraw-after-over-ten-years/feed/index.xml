Exactly- all that new and not needed &quot;preview&quot; stuff slows it WAY down if you are doing heavy work in there! Some things retro is better, &quot;upgrades&quot; have been NOT for several years now IMO!]]></description>

Thank you! Finally I find someone who understands the &quot;newer&quot; over patched over compiled code on top of code versions of these precise and intricate graphics software run slower with every &quot;upgrade&quot;. Persons who do not work on documents with excessive text or layers it is probably not noticeable. I have been using Corel since vs. 3.0 (not x3, but 1992) IMO 12.0 was the last efficient vs before all the unnecessary &quot;features&quot; started choking it&#039;s performance.
If &quot;real time previews&quot; (starting x4) can be turned off it would free up the CPU (even with 16G) what is causing the crash/freeze issues. A map on screen it is trying to &quot;show me&quot; fonts on the actual 6-8k pcs of artistic text, it gives up. Corel, I KNOW what a font looks like with a flyout...much of these silly preview features complicate its operation and for professionals is NOT needed.]]></description>

I envy your experience! I love CorelDRAW a lot and after using Adobe Illustrator for a few weeks, I just had to switch back, although I still have to endure all of the problems above. However, there are still a couple things I use AI for that CorelDRAW doesn&#039;t do well. Here is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://branditechture.agency/i-finally-got-a-workaround-for-coreldraws-most-famous-svg-bug/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. So when I need to import lots of SVG in a project, I just use Adobe Illustrator or Figma (Depending on whether it&#039;s for screen or print). 

Another thing Adobe Illustrator does well is resource management and hardware acceleration. Lastly, CorelDRAW hasn&#039;t seem to get around an issue when importing an EPS file, where complex effects turn raster.

Having said that, you&#039;d agree with me that even the most powerful computers won&#039;t solve some of these issues.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well written article. I read through it and, well, it&#039;s your experience and I can&#039;t dispute that. But then, I use Corel X8 on my desktop and it flies. When I say fly I mean flyyyyyy! 

It has never crashed on me, no matter what I do. I use it to lay out huge magazine documents up to 5GB. The saves happen in the background so it doesn&#039;t even disturb my work. Besides, if there&#039;s a power cut I simply hibernate and continue working later. 

My desktop has these specs:
Intel Core i5 3570K Quad core, RAM DDR3 24GB, 128GB SSD, 3TB HDD, no discreet GPU. 

Like I said, it&#039;s your experience. I think a dual core CPU is not the best for these apps. I also believe that if you multitask a lot you need at least 16GB of RAM. 

Peace.]]></description>

Okay, that settles it then 

CorelDRAW needs to work on their software]]></description>

I quite understand your assertion, but I have put all that into consideration and also examined them from different angles before writing the post. 
My PCs are by no means low-end for the latest version (and even future versions) of CorelDRAW, and as I have mentioned in the post, they both run Adobe Illustrator 2021 very well. 
Unfortunately, the lack of a true Hardware Acceleration means that even though you have the best specs in the world, CorelDRAW would still be unable to take advantage of it, thereby still freezing while doing some moderately complex and sometimes simple tasks.

PS: I have always used licensed versions of CorelDRAW (which were sourced either directly or gotten through a reseller/third party) and that has been the case for a long time now. So I&#039;m very sure it can&#039;t be that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m not into designs, but I love the breakdown 

nice piece...

though I suspect the problem may also come from the PC or originality of software gotten

this morning the “Adobe” Premier Pro my brother was using to edit a wedding video crashed and corrupted the the entire thing along 

He lost several hours of work, and it was very depressing 

So sometimes it’s hard to tell

most times using a very powerful PC and getting genuine products can save you a lot of headaches...

nonetheless your other points are very much valid. One needs to use better optimized and structured softwares that are also being used by the majority]]></description>

I learned CorelDRAW first and only I only took an interest in Photoshop for the purpose of raster editing, text and image manipulation, and overall better effects. My only regret is that I didn&#039;t quite try learning Adobe After Effects until recently. To work best with AE, you would need either PS or AI in your workflow. Using mainly CorelDRAW could be dangerously limiting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny thing bro is that I learnt Corel draw before Photoshop and today I can&#039;t really remember how to use it because I&#039;ve rarely ever had to use it. I just design on Photoshop and save as PDF, or better still send the PSD file since people can open PSD files on Corel draw. I implore you to learn after effects, it might seem daunting at first but it will be worth it.]]></description>
