										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Tech guys are all about the value their car gives them, not the money; that is not their problem. They want to park at the gym on a hot Saturday morning and be the center of attraction, not the guy whose car blows thick clouds every time.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are that tech guy looking for a car in Nigeria, there are car brands you should avoid, including the Toyota Sienna. Trust me, I have nothing against this car brand, but even you will agree that it doesn&#8217;t go with your style, and the list goes on and on.</span></p>
<p><span>Some cars will cause you more trouble than they&#8217;re worth, and you don&#8217;t want to worry about car repairs when there&#8217;s a code to crack. If you&#8217;re that tech guy who just hit the <em>milli</em> and wants a nice car, you&#8217;re in the right place.</span></p>
<p><span> At the end of this article, I will give you a heads-up on what to look out for in a car as a tech bro. I&#8217;m considering everything from aesthetics to speed, <a href="https://branditechture.agency/lifestyle/low-maintenance-mercedes-benz-cars-for-tech-guys/">reliability and safety</a>.</span></p>
<h2>5 Nigerian Cars To Avoid As A Tech Guy</h2>
<div id="attachment_17778" style="width: 950px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17778" class="wp-image-17778 size-large" title="Cars To Avoid As A Tech Bro" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-1024x736.jpg" alt="Cars To Avoid As A Tech Bro" width="940" height="676" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-1024x736.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-300x216.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-768x552.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-480x345.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro.jpg 1057w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><p id="caption-attachment-17778" class="wp-caption-text">Toyota Sienna</p></div>
<h3>1. Avoid The Toyota Sienna</h3>
<p><span>The Toyota Sienna is one of the best minivans on the market. It is roomy, comfortable, and stylish, with a powertrain that provides 245 horsepower. It has an EPA fuel rating of 36 mpg in the city and 36 mpg on the highway. </span></p>
<p><span>On the interior, you&#8217;ll see a center console that runs from the dashboard to the center armrest. The Toyota Sienna&#8217;s newest infotainment system is a 9.0-inch touchscreen display that sits upright over the climate controls on the dashboard. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CarPlay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple CarPlay</a>, Android Auto, and Amazon Alexa connection are standard, and the van&#8217;s interior has seven USB outlets. </span></p>
<p><span>As for safety, the Toyota Sienna comes with blind-spot monitoring and its Safety Sense 2.0 bundle of driver-assistance features. It earned five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHTSA</a>, for safety and a predicted reliability score of 74 out of 100. </span></p>
<p><span>Why, then, should you avoid it? We can all agree that Siennas are meant for large families because which tech guy needs an 8-seater car? And the aesthetics are basic, not cool. Remember, you&#8217;ll see and drive your car every day. It better looks good.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_17779" style="width: 950px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17779" class="size-large wp-image-17779" title="Cars To Avoid As A Tech Bro 1" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-1-1024x752.jpg" alt="Cars To Avoid As A Tech Bro 1" width="940" height="690" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-1-1024x752.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-1-300x220.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-1-768x564.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-1-480x353.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-1.jpg 1055w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><p id="caption-attachment-17779" class="wp-caption-text">Kia Soul</p></div>
<h3>2. Stay Away From The Kia Soul</h3>
<p><span>The Kia Soul is a small, boxy, subcompact car offered in various trims and powertrain configurations. Beautiful car but too problematic; the Kia Soul is prone to oil leaks. Such repairs are expensive, but the most annoying part is that it is frequent. </span></p>
<p><span>Kia Soul owners also say the car has suspension issues. The front wheel bearings and suspension springs are prone to failure. Furthermore, steering pins and tie rod system components might break, resulting in ongoing suspension troubles and costly repairs.</span></p>
<p><span>That&#8217;s not the only problem Kia Souls have; there are reports that the Kia Soul could lose power unexpectedly while driving. Most of them are caused by catalytic converter damage induced by high exhaust temperatures. Imagine you&#8217;re cruising on Third Mainland bridge, and your car ceases, not cool. </span></p>
<p><span>The power problem causes engine components to fail and, in extreme cases, can result in a fire beneath the hood. Yes, the Soul is prone to catching fire. It is a serious issue, and Kia recalled nearly 380,000 vehicles due to fire risks in 2021. But you&#8217;re in Nigeria, so even if there were a recall, you wouldn&#8217;t benefit from it.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_17780" style="width: 950px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17780" class="size-large wp-image-17780" title="2012 Acura TL" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-2-1024x755.jpg" alt="Cars To Avoid As A Tech Bro 2" width="940" height="693" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-2-1024x755.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-2-300x221.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-2-768x567.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-2-480x354.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-2.jpg 1052w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><p id="caption-attachment-17780" class="wp-caption-text">2012 Acura TL</p></div>
<h3>3. Leave The 2012 Acura TL Alone</h3>
<p><span>The 2012 Acura TL is one of the best-equipped sedans in its class, offering a strong V6 engine, excellent handling and braking ability, and a comfortable ride. Standard equipment on the 2012 Acura TL includes leather upholstery, heated front seats, a power sunroof, automatic climate control, and Bluetooth. </span></p>
<p><span>2012 Acura is not bad on fuel efficiency either. It has an EPA rating of 20/29 mpg city/highway. So when fuel prices go up at year-end, you can trust your car not to empty your bank account. </span></p>
<p><span>Some reviewers say the brake is powerful, while others say it feels numb. You need a sound brake system for the Nigerian road where most drivers aren&#8217;t very sane but let&#8217;s not forget safety. </span></p>
<p><span>No one plans to ram their car onto another one, but if it happened, you&#8217;d trust your car to save you, right? The 2012 Acura TL is not that car. It has an NHTSA rating of two over five for the frontal crash test and an overall NHTSA safety rating of three over five stars. Dear tech guy, you work so hard to make millions; there&#8217;s no way you want your career to end because your car couldn&#8217;t protect you.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_17781" style="width: 950px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17781" class="size-large wp-image-17781" title="Cars To Avoid As A Tech Bro 3" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-3-1024x665.jpg" alt="Cars To Avoid As A Tech Bro 3" width="940" height="610" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-3-1024x665.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-3-300x195.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-3-768x498.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-3-480x312.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-3.jpg 1228w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><p id="caption-attachment-17781" class="wp-caption-text">Tesla</p></div>
<h3>4. Don&#8217;t Buy A Tesla</h3>
<p><span>I know you didn&#8217;t see this coming, but that Tesla car you admire is not suitable for you. Sure, you love Elon Musk&#8217;s technology, and I agree, the guy is a tech genius, but you&#8217;re a tech guy in Nigeria, not Canada. The <a href="https://www.tesla.com/models" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Model S</a> has a 396-mile range, 1,020 horsepower, and an overall top speed of 200 miles per hour, a true classic. Plus, the Model S has cutting-edge technology and a lovely interior. </span></p>
<p><span>Nigerians love luxury cars; no matter how expensive a car is, at least two people in Nigeria will buy it. I&#8217;ve seen a Tesla before in Nigeria, and more may be on their way, but someone else should buy them, not you.</span></p>
<p><span>Charging will always be a problem. An electric vehicle needs to be charged in a proper electric charging station. Furthermore, the S model has suspension, body components, and electronics issues.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_17782" style="width: 950px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17782" class="size-large wp-image-17782" title="Cars To Avoid As A Tech Bro 4" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-4-1024x672.jpg" alt="Cars To Avoid As A Tech Bro 4" width="940" height="617" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-4-1024x672.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-4-300x197.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-4-768x504.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-4-480x315.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cars-To-Avoid-As-A-Tech-Bro-4.jpg 1182w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><p id="caption-attachment-17782" class="wp-caption-text">Subaru Outback</p></div>
<h3>5. Don&#8217;t Buy A Subaru Outback</h3>
<p><span>Yes, the Subaru Outback is a great wagon. It combines car-like handling and small-SUV performance with a slew of standard and optional technology, comfort, and driver-assistance systems. In the 2022 Outback, Subaru offers two versions of their Starlink infotainment system. </span></p>
<p><span>The entry-level models have a pair of 7-inch touch screens and a few buttons and knobs for quick navigation. However, the top speed of any Outback model is roughly 130 mph, which is too sluggish for you. You can get it for your significant other.</span></p>
<h2>What Should Tech Guys Look For In A Car?</h2>
<p><span>Many people buy cars only because it&#8217;s cheap that&#8217;s why we outlined <a href="https://branditechture.agency/lifestyle/best-luxury-cars-under-7-million-naira-for-young-techies-in-nigeria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the best 10 luxury cars under 7 million naira for naija techies</a>, but if you want the best of what is available, you must stop thinking about the cost. But tech guys supposedly have money because thereâ€™s money in the IT industry. With all that being said, here are some things that tech guys look out for when buying a car.</span></p>
<h3>Class</h3>
<p><span>Men love to drive in style, and tech guys raise the bar; they go for class. In case you havenâ€™t noticed, perception is everything. When youâ€™ve achieved a certain status in life, you no longer want the basic things. Your car choice will go beyond what helps you move faster to what gives you that stylish excellence. Tech guys and excellence go so well together.</span></p>
<h3>A Sound Navigation System</h3>
<p><span>GPS navigation systems help drivers navigate through unfamiliar locations. They can also show traffic conditions and even allow you to search for nearby restaurants, hotels, and other businesses. Some navigation systems also have voice control, so you can ask for directions without taking your hands off the wheel.</span></p>
<h3>Connectivity</h3>
<p><span>Connected cars allow you to check your vehicle&#8217;s status remotely to adjust climate control settings while you&#8217;re away from home or work using your smartphone. Many newer cars have built-in Wi-Fi hotspots so passengers can connect their smartphones and other devices while on the road.</span></p>
<p><span>Bluetooth allows you to connect your smartphone or another device to your car&#8217;s stereo system to listen to music or make calls while driving. For tech guys, music is therapeutic; what use is a car without music?</span></p>
<h3>Reliability</h3>
<p><span>If you&#8217;re buying a new car, don&#8217;t just focus on what looks good and drives well â€” take the time to find out how well it will hold up over time. Cars go through a lot during their lifetimes. They should handle everyday wear and tear without breaking down or needing expensive repairs too often. </span></p>
<p><span>A vehicle that gets excellent reliability ratings from <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports</a> or JD Power will probably be more dependable than one that doesn&#8217;t perform as well in these tests.</span></p>
<h3>Safety</h3>
<p><span>Safety is important in cars. When you&#8217;re driving, you need to be able to trust your car will keep you and your passengers safe. If you&#8217;re not comfortable with the safety of your vehicle, it&#8217;s time to get it checked out by a mechanic before driving it again. </span></p>
<p><span>The NHTSA has made progress in getting car companies to manufacture vehicles with better safety features. They test car safety on side crashes, front crash, and over-lapping. If your car gets five out of five stars on safety, it&#8217;s a good buy.</span></p>
<h3>Fuel Economy</h3>
<p><span>If you&#8217;re buying an SUV because you want more space for your family but don&#8217;t want gas bills that rival those of a yacht owner, check out fuel economy before committing yourself to anything too big or powerful. Smaller cars tend to get better gas mileage than larger ones.Â </span></p>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p><span>Cars arenâ€™t just machines for transportation; in a way, your car reflects your personality. Just like clothes can make or break your style, cars can make or break your image, which is why aesthetics are important. But beyond that, consider how safe, reliable, and fuel-efficient the car is before you buy.</span></p>

<h2>10 Best Affordable Luxury Cars Under 7 Million</h2>
<div id="attachment_17786" style="width: 950px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17786" class="size-large wp-image-17786" title="luxury cars" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/luxury-cars-1024x764.jpg" alt="luxury cars" width="940" height="701" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/luxury-cars-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/luxury-cars-300x224.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/luxury-cars-768x573.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/luxury-cars-480x358.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/luxury-cars.jpg 1155w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><p id="caption-attachment-17786" class="wp-caption-text">Lexus ES 330</p></div>
<h3>1. Lexus ES 330</h3>
<p>Hereâ€™s another luxury innovation by the Toyota Motor Corporation. Lexus ES 330 doesnâ€™t just tick the list of luxurious cars but prides itself in allowing its users to enjoy a thrilling ride with safety and confidence without spending so much.</p>
<p>Lexus ES 330 isnâ€™t your regular car; the aesthetics are superb. It features an incredible 3.3L 6-cylinder engine that produces 225 Horsepower and 240lb-ft of torque that transforms into a five-speed automatic transmission.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re not tall and you wish to get the Lexus ES 330, donâ€™t worry. This model has an adjustable driverâ€™s seat that can increase or reduce the height. This seat also has lumbar support that enhances comfort. This model also prides itself on the large cabin, which can contain up to eight people.</p>
<p>Whether locally or foreign fairly used, you can get Lexus ES 330 in Nigeria for as low as 2.5 million Naira. However, the price sometimes depends on the condition of the car. Depending on this, the price can increase to 3.5 million Naira.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s face it; Mercedes-Benz is never cheap to own. Still, there are options for young tech guys who want the 3-point star ride without spending a fortune on periodical maintenance.</p>
<p>What determines the maintenance cost of a Benz car goes beyond mechanical or electrical fixes from time to time. You also want to put a great deal of thought into the Model age, service history, and location where you will use the Benz.</p>
<p>As a young techie looking for the best low-maintenance Benz cars to buy, you want to steer clear from models like the Metris and Sprinter since their average yearly maintenance is around $2,500. That&#8217;s pretty high.</p>
<p>With my exposure to Mercedes Benz models over the years and a little more digging into a pool of data from giant auto review sites, I&#8217;ve put together a list of the seven classy Benz cars that are great for tech guys and economy-friendly to maintain in the long run.</p>
<p>This will help you in your buying decision to save your budget and your vehicle from major repair costs.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get right into it.</p>
<h2>List of Best Benz Cars with Low-Maintenance Costs for Techies</h2>
<p>As you probably know, the sticker price is one of many things you will pay to own a Benz car.</p>
<p>During my extensive discussion with various technicians who see cars getting fixed day in and day out, I discovered that many Benz owners spend more money maintaining Brakes, Oil changes, Spark plugs, Transmission service, Coolant service, Tires, and Smog checks.</p>
<p>Given the status of the German vehicle, these services could set you back thousands of dollars annually compared to regular Chinese cars.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you stand a chance to spend less on maintenance while enjoying Merc if you drive any of these models:</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://repairpal.com/reliability/mercedes-benz/c350" rel="noopener">Repairpal&#8217;s reliability rating</a> of the 2010 Mercedes-Benz C350 estimates average annual maintenance costs to be $720, influenced by the age, mileage, and location the vehicle is often used.</p>
<p>This Mercedes-Benz C-Class is one of the best options you can think of if you need a Benz car with the luxurious look of a classy techie but low maintenance cost. However, the model seems to be a better fit for handling than for comfort (many C-class do, too)</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t recommend the C350 if you ply curvy roads most of the time, but the vehicle has a fair chance of hitting 200,000 miles or more if you play your cards well in the area of maintenance routines.</p>
<p>The average buying price of the 3.5-liter V6 equipped vehicle starts from around $39,500 and is known for its high-quality parts like other Benz models.</p>
<p>The 2010 Mercedes-Benz C350 releases 268 Horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. It will stay in good condition for a very long time if you follow the affordable-to-achieve German manufacturer&#8217;s maintenance guidelines.</p>
<h3>2. 2012 Mercedes-Benz E350</h3>
<div id="attachment_17689" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17689" class="wp-image-17689 size-full" title="2012 Mercedes Benz E350 1" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2012-Mercedes-Benz-E350-1.jpg" alt="2012 Mercedes Benz E350 " width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2012-Mercedes-Benz-E350-1.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2012-Mercedes-Benz-E350-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2012-Mercedes-Benz-E350-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2012-Mercedes-Benz-E350-1-480x360.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-17689" class="wp-caption-text">2012 Mercedes Benz E350. ðŸ“¸: <em>The Car Connection</em></p></div>
<p>Generally, you can expect a Mercedes-Benz E-Class to gulp about $11,224 for maintenance and repairs during its first ten years of service. While this beats the industry average for luxury cars, the 2012 Mercedes-Benz E350 offers more.</p>
<p>According to the leading provider of auto repair and maintenance information, Repairpal, <a target="_blank" href="https://repairpal.com/cars/mercedes-benz/e350/2012#:~:text=The%20annual%20maintenance%20cost%20of,%2C%20mileage%2C%20location%20and%20shop." rel="noopener">the average upkeep cost of the Mercedes-Benz E350</a> annually is around $788. It is a reasonable maintenance cost for a full-size luxury sedan.</p>
<p>With an impressive 3.5-liter V6 engine that produces 302 horsepower, E350 is an excellent catch for the average &#8216;tech bro&#8217; willing to buy a German car on a budget. However, you have to keep in mind that the vehicle requires factory-recommended maintenance if it&#8217;s going to be on the road for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on average, you can expect the Mercedes-Benz E350 to last, hitting 15,000 miles in 15 years.</p>

<div id="attachment_17687" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17687" class="size-full wp-image-17687" title="2014 Mercedes Benz GLK350" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2014-Mercedes-Benz-GLK350-1.jpg" alt="2014 Mercedes Benz GLK350 " width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2014-Mercedes-Benz-GLK350-1.jpg 1280w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2014-Mercedes-Benz-GLK350-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2014-Mercedes-Benz-GLK350-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2014-Mercedes-Benz-GLK350-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2014-Mercedes-Benz-GLK350-1-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p id="caption-attachment-17687" class="wp-caption-text">2014 Mercedes Benz GLK350. ðŸ“¸: <em>Sherwood Park Toyota</em> via YouTube</p></div>
<p>It is only possible to list low-maintenance luxury cars by mentioning this 2014 Mercedes-Benz GLK350.</p>

<h3>5. 2020 Mercedes-Benz SL450</h3>
<div id="attachment_17686" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17686" class="size-full wp-image-17686" title="5. 2020 Mercedes Benz SL450 1" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5.-2020-Mercedes-Benz-SL450-1.jpg" alt="2020 Mercedes Benz SL450" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5.-2020-Mercedes-Benz-SL450-1.jpg 1600w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5.-2020-Mercedes-Benz-SL450-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5.-2020-Mercedes-Benz-SL450-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5.-2020-Mercedes-Benz-SL450-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5.-2020-Mercedes-Benz-SL450-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5.-2020-Mercedes-Benz-SL450-1-480x320.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5.-2020-Mercedes-Benz-SL450-1-1320x880.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-17686" class="wp-caption-text">2020 Mercedes Benz SL450 ðŸ“¸: <em>Edmunds</em></p></div>
<p>The 2020 Mercedes-Benz SL450 is a luxurious two-seat retractable-hardtop vehicle that offers more comfort and reliability than most Benz lineups.</p>
<p>The vehicle is not a hundred percent pass on many grounds, but it is the closest thing to perfection regarding low upkeep cost. With as low as $908, you will keep the SL450 running perfectly throughout the year in excellent condition.</p>
<p>This is a reasonable maintenance cost compared to the thousands of dollars that most other Benz cars gulp annually.</p>
<p>The 2020 Mercedes-Benz SL450 has a potent 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 that dismisses 362 horsepower. It is one of the Benz makes that has a surprisingly low maintenance cost.</p>
<h3>6. 2020 Mercedes C200</h3>
<div id="attachment_17685" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17685" class="size-full wp-image-17685" title="2020 Mercedes C200" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2020-Mercedes-C200-1.jpg" alt="2020 Mercedes C200 " width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2020-Mercedes-C200-1.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2020-Mercedes-C200-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2020-Mercedes-C200-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2020-Mercedes-C200-1-480x360.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-17685" class="wp-caption-text">2020 Mercedes C200 ðŸ“¸: The Car Connection</p></div>
<p>The 2020 Mercedes C200 is my all-time favorite as long as the discussion of Mercedes Benz is in play. The vehicle is not only considered a decently reliable Mercedes model but also costs low when it comes to maintenance.</p>
<p>The C200 price isn&#8217;t encouraging for techies on a budget, especially when you place it alongside your typical Japanese car brand. But incredible things come at a price, Yeah?</p>
<p>And, what&#8217;s the point when the Benz model is cheaper to maintain than most of its German Luxury alternatives?</p>
<p>Upkeep routines like a simple oil change for the 2020 Mercedes C200 will cost around $150, including parts and labor, while full service for a C-class costs around $500.</p>
<h3>7. 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS550</h3>
<div id="attachment_17684" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17684" class="size-full wp-image-17684" title="2017 Mercedes Benz GLS550 1" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2017-Mercedes-Benz-GLS550-1.jpg" alt="2017 Mercedes Benz GLS550 1" width="1920" height="1367" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2017-Mercedes-Benz-GLS550-1.jpg 1920w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2017-Mercedes-Benz-GLS550-1-300x214.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2017-Mercedes-Benz-GLS550-1-1024x729.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2017-Mercedes-Benz-GLS550-1-768x547.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2017-Mercedes-Benz-GLS550-1-1536x1094.jpg 1536w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2017-Mercedes-Benz-GLS550-1-480x342.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2017-Mercedes-Benz-GLS550-1-1320x940.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><p id="caption-attachment-17684" class="wp-caption-text">2017 Mercedes Benz GLS550 ðŸ“¸: <em>Select Luxury Cars</em></p></div>
<p>The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS550 has a young family demographic appeal as a full-size SUV. So, you will find many young guys buying this Benz model, which makes it a good fit for an average tech guy with a wife and children.</p>
<p>But still, another significant reason to consider the GLS550 is the low maintenance fee which puts it ahead of its alternatives like the Cadillac Escalade and even Audi&#8217;s Q7.</p>
<p>It will only cost you around $908 annually to maintain the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS550, allowing you to enjoy this luxury car&#8217;s benefits for a long time. It is equipped with a blistering turbo V8 and requires fewer visits to the repair shop for fixes if appropriately used.</p>
<h2>Reasons Why These Benz Cars are Cheaper to Maintain than Others</h2>
<p>These Benz models have been reviewed to be the best in low maintenance areas based on data from consumer surveys, up-close repair shop interviews, car history reports from RepairPal, and my exposure to a series of Mercedes lineups.</p>
<p>If you pay close attention, you will notice that all these Benz cars have something in common that makes them cost less for upkeep in the long run.</p>
<p>Similar features include simple technology, accessible replacement parts, and ample room under the hood of these cars that reduce the labor cost during repairs.</p>
<p>These Benz models appear to have a less complicated technology that makes it easier and quicker to observe repairs or maintenance routines.</p>
<p>Little wonder why many of the low-maintenance Benz cars are of older models since newer lineups are more complicated. In addition, these cars have common, standardized replacement parts, making their repairs cheaper.</p>
<p>Maintenance routines like regular oil changes, proper damage repair, and other essential tasks are required to guarantee the reliability of any Benz car. But observing this routine can be expensive for the typical Benz, but the few models reviewed earlier are going against the odds.</p>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Mercedes-Benz has a glorified reputation for making desirable premium cars. While most of their vehicles are expensive, we have walked through some of the best low-maintenance Mercedes-Benz models every Tech guy can buy.</p>
<p>If it were up to me, I recommend you choose the 2020 Mercedes C200. Not only is the C200 a decently reliable Mercedes model, but it is also a reasonably affordable car to maintain compared to many other Mercedes models on a broader comparative analysis.</p>
<p>The C200, indeed, is not a cheap buy like the regular American vehicle but is still cheaper to maintain than most of its German Luxury alternatives &#8211; a simple oil change will cost around $150 on average, with full service starting from as low as $500.</p>
<p>This is on the low side of spending compared to what Benz S-class owners spend for an oil change ($300 on average) and full service (around $1,400).</p>
