										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave had just unveiled their rebranded look at the &#8220;Flutterwave 3.0&#8221; virtual event which was held on the 18th February 2022, 5:00 pm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave, which have now reclaimed the top spot as the most valuable African payment startup, also unveiled a range of new products and services, including FinTech as a Service for <a class="extlink" href="https://www.finleycms.com/what-is-embedded-finance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">embedded finance</a>, SME business loans for its users, issuing of debit cards, and the inclusion of Apple Pay and Google Pay to its payment options.</span></p>

<p>The famous Flutterwave logo (shown above) has now been confirmed obsolete after the FinTech company announced to the world that it would be wearing a new look. It may, however, take some time for<a href="https://freebrandlogos.com/download/flutterwave-new-logo-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the new logo</a> to be updated across all their media platforms.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the new Flutterwave logo;</p>
<div id="attachment_15283" style="width: 950px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15283" class="wp-image-15283 size-large" title="Flutterwave New Logo" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Flutterwave-New-Logo-e1645272151232-1024x775.jpg" alt="Flutterwave New Logo" width="940" height="711" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Flutterwave-New-Logo-e1645272151232-1024x775.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Flutterwave-New-Logo-e1645272151232-300x227.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Flutterwave-New-Logo-e1645272151232-768x581.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Flutterwave-New-Logo-e1645272151232-480x363.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Flutterwave-New-Logo-e1645272151232-1320x999.jpg 1320w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Flutterwave-New-Logo-e1645272151232.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><p id="caption-attachment-15283" class="wp-caption-text">Flutterwave New Logo</p></div>
<p>Recall that Nigeria&#8217;s largest Telco, <a href="https://branditechture.agency/mtn-rebranded-look-is-stirring-public-outrage/">MTN, announced a revamp of their logo</a> earlier this week, with their new logo looking all black in a minimalism-inspired design. Well, Flutterwave has taken a different approach by utilizing at least, 5 distinct colours.</p>
<p>A lot of people have expressed their own opinions on the new Flutterwave logo, however, here&#8217;s one remark by Dare Adu-Samuels that really stood out:</p>
<blockquote><p>Butterfly. The movement of a butterfly in flight is called FLUTTER.</p>
<p>The first logo is the side view of a butterfly.</p>
<p>This new logo looks like the view from up.</p></blockquote>
<p>I quite resonate with that, and since butterflies are typically colourful creatures, it also explains why the new logo has multiple colours. However, as of the time of writing this article, we are still yet to fully see how the new logo would be applied across all their brand assets.</p>
<div id="attachment_15285" style="width: 950px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15285" class="wp-image-15285 size-large" title="Maria wearing Flutterwave Old Logo at the recently concluded Big Brother Naija edition titled Lockdown" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Maria-wearing-Flutterwave-Old-Logo-at-the-recently-concluded-Big-Brother-Naija-edition-titled-Lockdown-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Maria wearing Flutterwave Old Logo at the recently concluded Big Brother Naija edition titled Lockdown" width="940" height="940" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Maria-wearing-Flutterwave-Old-Logo-at-the-recently-concluded-Big-Brother-Naija-edition-titled-Lockdown-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Maria-wearing-Flutterwave-Old-Logo-at-the-recently-concluded-Big-Brother-Naija-edition-titled-Lockdown-300x300.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Maria-wearing-Flutterwave-Old-Logo-at-the-recently-concluded-Big-Brother-Naija-edition-titled-Lockdown-150x150.jpg 150w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Maria-wearing-Flutterwave-Old-Logo-at-the-recently-concluded-Big-Brother-Naija-edition-titled-Lockdown-768x768.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Maria-wearing-Flutterwave-Old-Logo-at-the-recently-concluded-Big-Brother-Naija-edition-titled-Lockdown-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Maria-wearing-Flutterwave-Old-Logo-at-the-recently-concluded-Big-Brother-Naija-edition-titled-Lockdown-480x480.jpg 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Maria-wearing-Flutterwave-Old-Logo-at-the-recently-concluded-Big-Brother-Naija-edition-titled-Lockdown-1320x1320.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><p id="caption-attachment-15285" class="wp-caption-text">Maria wearing Flutterwave&#8217;s old logo at the recently concluded Big Brother Naija edition titled Lockdown</p></div>
<p>Is the beautiful yellow accent gone forever? We&#8217;d have to wait to find out.</p>
<h2>User opinions on the new Flutterwave logo.</h2>
<p>Since its founding in 2016 by Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave has managed to build an army of loyal users. This is the first time the brand would be undergoing a massive revamp in its 5-year history and here&#8217;s what users have to say about it:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Flutterwave rebrands their logo.<br />I am curious to know why they did that.</p>
<p>The multicolor could mean varying service area or core values. The stem stroke has been ditched and the &quot;W&quot; is vivid. More like an inverted m of &quot;Meta&quot;</p>
<p>A font change too </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I like Flutterwave’s new website but I LOVED the old one because Muster’s logo was on the landing page. Many of the product designers lived in ‘Musters’ at the time, I think. Most of FW folks in the Muster community now are developers.</p>
<p>To them I say: Sneak the logo back in guys!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>After reading hundreds of reactions and comments from Facebook and Twitter, the new Flutterwave logo seems to be enjoying a much warmer welcome in contrast to <a href="https://branditechture.agency/mtn-rebranded-look-is-stirring-public-outrage/">MTN&#8217;s</a> new minimalistic logo.</p>
<p>I personally love Flutterwave&#8217;s old logo, but what are your own thoughts? Please comment below 😃.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://branditechture.agency/mtn-hynetflex-honest-review/">MTN</a>, Africa&#8217;s largest telecom operator, is planning a major rebrand on February 27th, which will include a new logo and the replacement of its previous tagline, &#8220;Everywhere you go,&#8221; with &#8220;Y&#8217;ello.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new logo is already visible outside MTN&#8217;s head office address on the N1 Expressway in South Africa.</p>
<p>MTN&#8217;s signature white, yellow, and red text on a blue oval has been replaced by a streamlined black on yellow logo.</p>
<p>On a yellow background, the block letters, &#8220;MTN&#8221; is encircled with a black oval outline around them.</p>
<div style="width: 940px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-15263-1" width="940" height="529" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-Logo-Transition-Animation.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-Logo-Transition-Animation.mp4">https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-Logo-Transition-Animation.mp4</a></video></div>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><em>Credit: @MTNGroup</em></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;ello&#8221; is written in stylized white letters on the same yellow background.</p>
<p>While the rebranding has started outside of MTN&#8217;s Johannesburg headquarters, it will be carried out throughout the company&#8217;s international outlets in phases.</p>
<p>The new logo, however, has been updated on all MTN&#8217;s social media platforms, including Facebook.</p>
<div id="attachment_15268" style="width: 902px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15268" class="size-full wp-image-15268" title="MTNs updated display profiles on Facebook" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTNs-updated-display-profiles-on-Facebook.png" alt="MTNs updated display profiles on Facebook" width="892" height="533" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTNs-updated-display-profiles-on-Facebook.png 892w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTNs-updated-display-profiles-on-Facebook-300x179.png 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTNs-updated-display-profiles-on-Facebook-768x459.png 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTNs-updated-display-profiles-on-Facebook-480x287.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px" /><p id="caption-attachment-15268" class="wp-caption-text">MTN&#8217;s updated display profiles on Facebook</p></div>
<p>Nompilo Morafo, MTN&#8217;s Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer, said the new look reflects the business&#8217;s transition from a <strong>telecommunications giant</strong> to a <strong>technology company</strong>.</p>
<p>The new brand will debut on February 27, according to her gist with <a href="https://TechCentral.co.za/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TechCentral.co.za</a>. She says the new logo is part of the organization&#8217;s &#8220;Ambition 2025&#8221; strategy, which aims to build &#8220;leading digital platforms for Africa&#8217;s progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>MTN has sought over 150 digital specialists in South Africa as part of its quest to become a full-fledged technology services company. Product designers, performance marketers, digital <a href="https://branditechture.agency/20-content-generation-ideas-for-your-brands-marketing/">content</a> producers, E-commerce gurus, full-stack developers, Scrum Masters, and business analysts are all needed.</p>
<p>The goal of this rebranding is to influence the public&#8217;s perception of MTN as well as its market worth. Short-form video content (MTN Shortz), music streaming (Music Plus), social media (MTN Ayoba), mobile money (MTN MoMo), voice, and data are among the services it now offers.</p>
<h2>Public reactions following MTN&#8217;s rebrand</h2>
<div id="attachment_15267" style="width: 950px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15267" class="wp-image-15267 size-large" title="MTN New Logo Download" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-New-Logo-Download-1024x546.png" alt="MTN New Logo" width="940" height="501" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-New-Logo-Download-1024x546.png 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-New-Logo-Download-300x160.png 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-New-Logo-Download-768x410.png 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-New-Logo-Download-480x256.png 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-New-Logo-Download-1320x704.png 1320w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-New-Logo-Download.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><p id="caption-attachment-15267" class="wp-caption-text">MTN&#8217;s new logo</p></div>
<p>While this may look to MTN like a really nice move, it&#8217;s certainly going to need some getting used to. Public opinions show that the new logo doesn&#8217;t quite connect well with a huge portion of their fan base.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/JCAdv_WX/status/873111372145479681</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I still can&#39;t wrap my head around the new MTN logo to be honest. It feels too lazy rather than minimal.</p>
<p>Black, yellow, oval (horizontal), and then MTN with Montserrat.</p>
<p>Not a fan of it, but it will grow on me, I hope.</p>
