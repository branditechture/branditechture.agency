					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://branditechture.agency/so-whats-wrong-with-the-glo-nin-advert-flagged-by-apcon/#comment-578&quot;&gt;Chioma&lt;/a&gt;.

Tbvh, I have watched TV programs (Especially music TV shows) where presenters/hosts dress like this. Although I understand that that is beyond the scope of APCON&#039;s purpose. Well, my opinion may be influenced by the fact that I have seen women also dress like this in the office and no one said anything about it. So why not an ad?]]></description>
