										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone at <a href="https://branditechture.agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branditechture</a> loves Big Brother Naija (a.k.a BBN, BB Naija) because there are loads of branding and <a href="https://branditechture.agency/big-brother-naija/bbn-2022/top-9-content-creation-lessons-to-learn-from-the-big-brother-naija-tv-show/">content marketing lessons</a> to learn from the award-winning reality TV show, and that&#8217;s why we have a dedicated page on our website for all Big Brother Season 7-related content. The BBN Season is also a great time to <a href="https://branditechture.agency/big-brother-naija/bbn-2022/6-tricks-to-grow-your-fb-and-twitter-followers-this-bb-naija-season-7/">grow your social media</a> following.</p>
<p>Well, if you are an ardent Big Brother Naija fan who doesn&#8217;t want to miss out on crucial updates about the show, it is important to know and have access to some apps and websites to follow the latest news and trending topics about the Big Brother Naija show even when you are not in front of a TV Screen.</p>
<p>For this reason, we have compiled a list of top ten websites to keep up with all the arena games, evictions, and parties on the Big Brother Naija show</p>
<h2>1. DStv App: Big Brother Naija Channel</h2>
<p>The Official DStv dedicated a channel for the Big Brother Naija show, and if you have the DStv app on your phone, you can follow live updates on the show from your mobile phone, and the same thing applies if you have the DStv satellite in your home, you can as well watch the show on your TV (if you are home). The DStv app is available on both android and iOS.</p>
<h2>2. GOtv App</h2>
<p>Just like DStv, GOtv is also a product of <em>Multichoice Group. Y</em>ou can watch live updates of the Big Brother Naija show using either your GOtv app or from your Gotv Decoder when at home. The beautiful thing about this is that you do not need a separate subscription to watch the show on your mobile phone. Your GOtv/DStv subscription would be more than enough.</p>
<h2>3. <a href="https://www.showmax.com/eng/home" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ShowMax</a></h2>
<p>For just $2.99 per month on mobile, Showmax, a Netflix rival in Africa, is almost free (1,200 Naira). In addition to providing live Big Brother Naija content, ShowMax provides exclusive information on what is taking place in the Big Brother house.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have access to the latest show recaps and behind-the-scenes footage of the contestants&#8217; experiences on the show. You can even use the app to cast your vote on who you think should win Big Brother Naija!</p>
<p>ShowMax has a variety of content, including movies, TV shows, and documentaries. There are also several international series available in multiple languages. You can access ShowMax on your computer, on your mobile phone, or on your TV.</p>
<h2>4. <a href="https://www.dstv.com/africamagic/en-ng/show/big-brother-naija/season/6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Africa Magic DStv Official Website</a></h2>
<p>Just like we all know that Big Brother Naija doesn&#8217;t have an official streaming website or website of any form, however, since DStv is one of the major sponsors and facilitator of the Big Brother Naija show, they have added the live show to the official <a href="https://www.dstv.com/africamagic/en-ng/show/big-brother-naija/season/6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DStv Africa Magic Page.</a></p>
<p>Let me reiterate that the Big Brother Naija TV Show DOES NOT have a website of its own, so you may safely disregard any website posing as an official platform and asking offering to help you get into the BBN House.</p>

<h2>5. Pulse NG Big Brother Naija</h2>
<p>Pulse.ng, a popular Nigeria blog, has a dedicated webpage for Big Brother Naija updates</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the page link: <a href="https://www.pulse.ng/search?q=BBNaija" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Pulse NG Big Brother Naija update</a>.</p>
<h2>6. Legit NG Tv Show Page</h2>
<p>Just like Pulse NG, legit ng is another popular Nigerian news, gist and gossip blog that willfully dedicated its <a href="https://www.legit.ng/entertainment/tv-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV shows</a> page to Big Brother Naija Updates</p>
<h2>7. Blogs Dedicated To Big Brother Naija Updates</h2>
<ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Big Brother Naija reality TV show has never run out of sponsors at any given edition, and the stars and winners of the challenges and indoor games can make good money, both from winning games and from <a href="https://branditechture.agency/how-a-brand-ambassador-can-help-grow-your-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand ambassadorship</a>.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the Big Brother Naija show has maintained its position as the <a href="https://branditechture.agency/a-very-brief-history-of-tv-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV</a> reality show with the largest viewership in the whole of Africa.</p>
<p>One thing about <a href="https://branditechture.agency/big-brother-naija/all-big-brother-naija-logos-season-1-to-season-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Brother Naija</a> is that the sponsors play a vital role in determining how interesting the indoor games (known to housemates as <strong><em>&#8220;Tasks&#8221;</em></strong>) would be, and as a contestant, knowing who the sponsors are, can give a rough idea of how lucrative any brand ambassadorship deal would be. For this reason, both the viewers and contestants of the TV show always want to know who would be sponsoring the Big Brother Naija season in view.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abeg</strong></em> was the main sponsor of the recently concluded season 6 <em><strong>(Shine Ya Eye)</strong></em>, having taken over from <strong>Betway</strong>, who sponsored season 4 &#8211; <em><strong>(Pepper Dem)</strong></em> and season 5¬† <em><strong>(Lockdown)</strong> </em>of the show. The main sponsor of seasons 1,2, and 3, was Payporte ‚Äì A lifestyle &amp; fashion outlet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Big Brother Naija show is being aired for the seventh year in a row now, and every season has come with its own dimension, slogan, identity, different housemates, winners, and, most importantly, different logos.</p>
<p>Recall, that a TV show started as <em>Big Brother Africa</em> back in 2014, but following a disastrous start, the show further faced a series of organizational instability, internal turmoil, and ultimately, a lack of sponsors. In the wake of that, Big Brother Naija returned to the screens, after a long break from its maiden edition in 2006.</p>
<p>Here are all the Big Brother Naija logos from the season 1 season up to the current season 7 themed &#8220;Level Up.&#8221;</p>

<p>As we all know, the Big Brother reality TV show always takes social media by storm and it is not so uncommon for you to see <em><strong>&#8220;#BBNaija&#8221;</strong></em> hashtags dominate social media platforms like Twitter. In the anticipation of the Big <em><strong>Brother Naija Season 7</strong></em>, this year&#8217;s edition of the popular TV show is tipped to be the biggest and most successful one ever.</p>
<p>However, amid the certain noise and buzz, here are <em><strong>proven</strong></em> tips to follow in order to take advantage of this year&#8217;s Big Brother Naija season 7 to grow your followers on Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<h2>1. Optimize Your Facebook And Twitter Page</h2>
<p>The first step is to make your Facebook or Twitter Profile aesthetically <a href="https://branditechture.agency/how-to-optimize-your-facebook-profile-for-quality-leads/">more appealing</a> to people for them to follow your page. This step is very important as there is no growth hack that will work if your profile page looks scanty or distasteful.</p>

<pre>We can help you design catchy social media banners and covers. Just place an order via <a href="https://branditechture.agency/start-a-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Get Started"><strong>this link</strong></a>, and we would be in touch with you within a few minutes.</pre>
<p>This page should have an attractive cover picture as well as a profile picture. You should also create a catchy description (called <em><strong>&#8220;Bio&#8221;</strong></em>) with brief information about what you want people to know and exactly what it is you have to offer them.</p>
<h2>2. Create Curated BB Naija Posts and Publish On Your Pages</h2>
<p>Posting a variety of <strong>curated</strong> BB Naija content and trends that resonate with your existing followers is a very great way to grow your social media following.</p>

<p>Posting trending <em><strong>but relevant</strong></em> Big Brother Naija topics will definitely keep your followers engaged and wanting more. Please note that not every Big Brother Naija content would be applicable to your brand, hence the emphasis on the word, <strong>&#8220;curate&#8221;. </strong></p>
<p>There are a ton of different formats for posting content. And these include pictures, GIFs, videos, Q&amp;As, and more.</p>
<p>You can experiment with different content formats to see which gets the best engagement rate from your followers. Don&#8217;t limit your creativity as there is nothing stopping you from combining different formats (<em>pictures + GIFs + videos combo</em>) when delivering content to your followers.</p>
<p>Another great tip is to keep your content fresh and updated always. If you want your followers to keep coming back to your account, you have to keep them interested. If you stop posting content for too long, followers will forget about you and find another account to follow to catch up with the latest news. That may sound harsh and unforgiving, but that&#8217;s just the reality these days.</p>
<h2>3. Sharing Your Social Media Post Across Active and Engaging Groups</h2>
<p>There are several active, engaging Big Brother Naija Groups out there on Facebook where you can share your content. When sharing your post across different groups, make sure to tailor the message for each audience. This will help you get the most engagement and reach the largest potential audience.</p>
<p>Be sure to include a call to action (such as <em>&#8220;Follow my page for more updates&#8221;</em>) in each post. This will encourage engagement and let your community know how they can connect with you.</p>
<h2>4. Use Trending BB Naija Hashtags</h2>
<p>Hashtags are one of the most effective ways to get your content to reach lots of people and generate more engagement for your social media profile, most especially on Twitter. The more hashtags you use, the more likely people will find your content when they search for those hashtags.</p>
<p>Choosing the right hashtags can be tricky, but there are some tools available to help you with hashtag research. For example, Twitter has a free hashtag research tool that shows trending topics and the most popular hashtags on Twitter based on popularity and engagement rate. You can then use this data to choose which hashtags to include in your post.</p>
<p>Using these tools will help you find popular hashtags that match up with the type of content you post so that it gets seen by as many people as possible.</p>
<h2>5. Post Content Featuring A Big Brother Naija Contestant In Focus</h2>
<p>The keyword here is <strong>&#8220;In Focus&#8221;.</strong> Posting content featuring a Big Brother Naija contestant in focus can blow up your account in a very short time and skyrocket your account engagement, especially if it is a fan&#8217;s favourite. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean you should turn your business page into a &#8220;stan account&#8221;. <em>Stan account</em> is a fancy word for &#8220;fan account&#8221;, which is an account dedicated to posting updates on only one contestant.</p>
<p>With that being said, You should focus on a different contestant at any given time.</p>
<p>A Big Brother Naija fan can&#8217;t resist the urge to check out a piece of news featuring any of the contestants when they are scrolling on social media, it always grabs their attention, and this is what makes a post that features a contestant go viral.</p>
<p>We have seen this in action several times as this tip has been used by several media companies such as <em>Legit.ng,</em> and <em>Zikoko!</em>, and its no doubt that all those posts get a ton of engagement.</p>
<h2>6. Employ Argumentative Content As Part Of Your Content Strategy</h2>
<p>This is especially important if you are trying to attract a new audience to your page. When you are creating content, think about how you can frame it as an argument for your readers.</p>
<p>Let us use a former Big Brother Naija housemate as an example: &#8220;<em>Pere</em> may be more charismatic than Laycon, but if you consider his poor communication skill, arrogance, and other non-pleasing behaviour, Laycon is still better than pere (This is just an example).</p>
<p>You can, therefore, make an argument for why someone should consider <em>Laycon</em> to <em>Pere</em>. This can spur attention from prospects who might otherwise not have shown interest in your business page or profile.</p>
<p>With argumentative content, you want to make sure that your readers know that they will be reading an essay-style piece that may challenge their current stand on a topic.</p>
<p>The last thing that you want to do is cause confrontation or tension among your readers, but you do want to spark a conversation and make sure that your readers know that they can expect to be challenged with this type of content.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Smart<a href="https://branditechture.agency/how-to-use-brand-clarity-to-improve-your-marketing-message/"> business people</a> have been using the Big Brother Naija TV show to grow their media following for a very long time now and all the tips I have shared above can certainly help you generate more followers for both your Facebook and Twitter profiles, even as a business.</p>
<p>Choosing a trend that is relevant to your company or industry can produce incredible results. And as we all know, that Big Brother Naija is all about trends. Once you have identified a promising trend, you will want to ensure that the content you are sharing is easy to understand and has click-worthy headlines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a business owner whose business or company thrives on content marketing, what can you learn from the BB Naija? and how can you increase your engagement rate by using this TV show as a source of inspiration when crafting relevant content for your brand?</p>
<p>As we all know, the Big Brother Naija TV show is the biggest reality show in Nigeria. And it&#8217;s not just the biggest show on Nigerian television, it&#8217;s one of the most-watched reality shows in the whole of Africa with a solid fan base.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Big Brother Naija</em></strong> show has kicked off for the seventh successive season in a row, which is a huge achievement. Just like every TV show needs to be plotted, the Big Brother Naija&#8217;s plot is pretty simple ‚Äì 26 contestants must live together in a house for a certain period of time, and one of the housemates who have managed to avoid an eviction until the last day wins the grand prize. The winner is determined via a voting process.</p>
<p>Here are a few content creation lessons to learn from the BBN TV show that are guaranteed to give your <a href="https://branditechture.agency/20-content-generation-ideas-for-your-brands-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="20 Content-Generation Ideas for Your Brand‚Äôs Marketing">content marketing</a> game some fresh air, spark some engagement, and increase your followers.</p>
<h2>1. Repurpose Your Existing Content.</h2>
<p>One of the best ways for marketers to create more value for their customers is to repurpose existing content.</p>
<p>Big Brother Naija always goes big in repurposing their reality show every single season. They make sure that every new season is better than the previous one. This is why every new season comes with different dimensions from the previous season, different logos, different slogans, a better showroom compared to the previous season, and many more brand repurposing before airing the show.</p>
<p>All of this brand and content repurposing are the reasons why the BBN reality TV show becomes more entertaining every single season and makes people excited to follow all through. For example, the show house used in Big Brother Naija season reportedly cost 2.5 billion NGN to build from start to finish. When people heard the jaw-dropping cost, they automatically started showing interest in the show, simply because they wanted to see how the new house looked like for it to cost that much.</p>
<p>The Big Brother Naija show audience skyrocketed all because they rebuilt and repurposed their show house. This is one of the powers of repurposing your existing content. The Big Brother Naija house had a show house before that everyone knows, but because they rebuilt the show house helped them skyrocket their audience in a very short period.</p>
<p>Repurposing your content allows you to reach a larger audience, and it also helps you generate more traffic and leads from the same content. Repurposing your content is a great way to inspire new blog posts, giving you more blog ideas for your marketing campaign.</p>
<h2>2. Create Scheduled Series for your Content</h2>
<p>As you know, Big Brother Naija is a reality show series, this helps them keep their audience engaged and makes them come back for more entertainment.</p>
<p>When you have a blog or website, you can create a series of blog posts that go together by using related topics. By doing this, you can engage your visitors for a longer period of time and keep them coming back for more.</p>
<p>The advantage of creating a series of blog posts is you can create more content, and this gives you more opportunities to drive traffic and generate leads.</p>
<p>Creating <em>scheduled series content</em> allows you to get more returning visitors, build your reputation as an expert in the field, and expand your reach beyond the original topic. Imagine you publish a blog post about leadership skills and then create a second post about how to communicate better at work. Both topics are related, but the communication piece will also attract readers who weren&#8217;t interested in the original post.</p>
<p>The more content you have for your business, the better the chance readers have of finding something that suits their interests. When publishing series content, make sure each post has a connection to the original topic but is broad enough to cover different aspects.</p>
<h2>3. Run A Giveaway To Grow Your Audience</h2>
<p>Big Brother Naija gives away mouth staggering amount every single season, and that&#8217;s a proven strategy for every business to grow their audience and engagement rate. Giving away prizes for free is a great way to attract a new audience and grow your social media following. You can offer something as simple as a premium resource,¬† discount code or coupon, or airtime.</p>
<p>You just have to frame the situation properly to let people know that there&#8217;s value in what you&#8217;re giving away. For example, let&#8217;s say that you&#8217;re a software company, and one of your products helps <a href="https://branditechture.agency/8-ways-your-small-business-can-benefit-from-branding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small businesses</a> manage their inventory. You could offer a free ebook about how to choose the right inventory software for your product to let people know how to find value in it.</p>
<h2>4. Host A Challenge or Contest</h2>
<p>It Is no longer news that Big Brother Naija is a challenge, and many people stay glued to the show to the end to know who is going to emerge winner of the challenge. Hosting a challenge or contest is a great way to generate buzz around your brand, motivate your team to achieve a set goal, and bring in new customers. Challenges can be anything from a contest to an event to a charitable donation.</p>
<p>In order to make your challenge successful, you&#8217;ll need to come up with a good prize or incentive. This prize should be something that will generate buzz and encourage people to participate.</p>
<p>You could offer a free product or service for the first person to achieve your goal or for the person who gives the best answer to your challenge question. The key is that you have to make sure that the prize is worth pursuing and will attract people&#8217;s attention.</p>
<h2>5. Share Your Company Story</h2>
<p>Every Big Brother Naija contestant has their own story. The big brother makes sure to put the story of every contestant of the show out there on the spotlight, and this plays a major role when the audience wants to determine who they like and will support among all contestants of the show, and this is something every business should copy and replicate in their own business too.</p>
<p>One of the most effective ways of telling your company&#8217;s story is by using <a href="https://www.tide.co/blog/business-tips/business-storytelling/#:~:text=Wrapping%20up-,What%20is%20business%20storytelling%3F,audience%20on%20an%20emotional%20level." target="_blank" rel="noopener">storytelling</a>. Storytelling is one of the oldest and most widely used ways of communicating. It has been around since the beginning of humankind, and it&#8217;s still as relevant as ever. It&#8217;s a powerful way of connecting with your target audience and helping them to understand your brand, its products, your mission, and your vision.</p>
<p>Sharing your story helps you build more trust in your brand, and people are more likely to buy from brands they like, so sharing your company&#8217;s story is one of the most effective ways of attracting new customers and building loyalty among existing customers. You can tell your story in many different ways, such as through blog posts, videos, images, <a href="https://branditechture.agency/advice/improve-your-social-media-brands-health-with-these-5-techniques/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> updates, contests, etc.</p>
<h2>6. Introduce Voting Or Polling Method To Your Business</h2>
<p>Big Brother Naija and voting are like 5&amp;6, and they go hand in hand. The show asks its viewers to vote for a housemate every week, and this is what gives the audience a chance to vote for who they want and remove who they don&#8217;t want from the show. This is a very important lesson that every business should learn from.</p>
<p>Knowing what your audience wants gives you more inspiration about the type of content they want, how you can help them solve their problem, and more importantly, it helps your business stay more relevant. There is no better way to find out what your customers think about your products or services than by asking them. This can be done by carrying out surveys or creating polls on social media platforms.</p>
<p>The best part is that there are numerous ways to do it, whether it is through email, social media, or even a poll on your website. What you want to do is create a voting or polling system or even a survey that is short and sweet but also provides a lot of detail for them to answer.</p>
<p>The last thing you want to do is make it so complicated that they click away from your site. What you are looking for are the nuggets of information that will help you to improve your products or services. What you learn can also be used to create new products or services that your customers actually want.</p>
<p>Not only does voting or polling your customers help to gather feedback, but it also helps to drive more engagement within your website and email marketing campaigns, which can <a href="https://branditechture.agency/marketing-tips/treating-your-customers-like-you-met-at-a-party-top-lead-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead to increased conversions</a> and more sales.</p>
<h2>7. Go Behind The Scene</h2>
<p>Big Brother Naija is a complete raw live show, and everything is aired in raw and in real-time. Going behind the scene of your business can give you more content inspiration that you can share with your audience.</p>
<p>This can help you stay relevant and keep customers engaged with your brand. You can use these <em><strong>behind-the-scenes contents</strong></em> to show your viewers what happens at your company each day. You can also use these contents to answer FAQs about your products or services. Customers might be curious about how your company works or what happens during certain parts of your business process.</p>
<p>By creating this behind-the-scenes content, you are giving your customers more information about your brand and products. This can increase trust between your brand and customers.</p>
<h2>8. Share Secret Or Hacks In Your Industry</h2>
<p>Showing contestants&#8217; secrets live on Tv is one of the reasons Big Brother Naija keeps trending every single time, the show keeps making different headlines and making new trends on social media every single day, and this has helped them in the long run to reach more people and grow in viewers.</p>
<p>As the internet and social media have become a part of our daily lives, it has also become more important for marketers and businesses to focus on creating content for their target audience.</p>
<p>When you are creating content for your business, social media, or any other form of marketing, try to think outside the box and focus on creating something unique and interesting for your audience. One of the best ways to do this is to share &#8220;hacks&#8221; and secrets in your industry. This will not only show your customers that you are knowledgeable in your field but will also create interesting and unique content, which is sure to resonate with your customers.</p>
<p>In order to share hacks in your industry, you will first need to research them. There are hundreds of different websites and forums where people in your industry discuss problems and issues. Once you have found a common issue that has been &#8220;hacked&#8221; and fixed, share the information on your website or social media to help your customers.</p>
<h2>9. Put Your Customers In the Spotlight.</h2>
<p>Do you Remember <em><strong>Ebuka</strong></em>? The director of the show, every time he talks on air, he usually shouts out to the audience that comments on their social media post by sharing their comments and displaying them on air. If you are a Big Brother Naija viewer and your comment gets displayed on the most popular tv streaming in Africa, won&#8217;t you feel important and appreciated for a second? this makes many of their users comment on their post in the hope of getting a shout-out from <em>Ebuka</em> one day.</p>
<p>The best way to increase sales and improve customer retention is to regularly interact with your customers. When you communicate with your customers, you can increase their trust in your brand and make them feel more valued. When customers feel appreciated, they are more likely to purchase from your brand again. Additionally, if you are able to solve their problems with your products or service, they will also be much more likely to recommend your brand to their network.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is by putting your customers in the spotlight. You can do this by posting updates on your social media accounts or doing Q&amp;As on your blog.</p>
<p>For example, you can post Instagram stories about a customer who bought something from your store and was really excited about it. In the caption, you can ask your customers to tag themselves, and you can reply to their comments with a question. You can also send emails to your subscribers with a poll. Ask them about the problems they are facing and the products you sell.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of content inspiration as a <a href="https://branditechture.agency/common-internet-marketing-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business owner</a> from entertainment shows like Big Brother Naija show. All the tips above can be helpful to you as a business owner, especially if you are trying to come up with new content ideas for your blog or social media channels.</p>
