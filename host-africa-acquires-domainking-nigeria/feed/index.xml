Sure, you can go ahead and host a website with DomainKing. So far, nothing has changed with the way they operate. However, I would recommend that you buy hosting from Namecheap instead. Better support, better server performance and more resource allocation — even their cheapest plan is about 10x better than what you get on DomainKing for about the same fee.

An issue you might encounter with Namecheap is making payments; i.e if your debit card does not support making international payments. If that&#039;s the case, you either borrow a friend&#039;s card and reimburse him/her, or just go the DomainKing way, which is not that bad for small websites.]]></description>
