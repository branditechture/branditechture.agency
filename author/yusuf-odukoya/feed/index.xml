										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">In a groundbreaking move that is set to reshape the creative content landscape, Shutterstock, a leading global creative platform, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Envato, a leader in digital creative assets and templates. This strategic acquisition promises to be a game-changer, combining the strengths of two industry titans and unleashing a wealth of opportunities for creatives, brands, and businesses worldwide.</p>
<h2 class="font-bold">The Envato Advantage: Unlimited Creative Content at Your Fingertips</h2>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">At the heart of this acquisition lies Envato&#8217;s flagship product, Elements – a creative subscription service that offers unlimited downloads of a diverse array of assets, templates, and more. Elements has gained a reputation as an intelligent creative companion, empowering creatives to bring their visions to life and leave a lasting mark on a global scale.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">With Envato Elements under its wing, Shutterstock will complement its existing offering with a leading unlimited multi-asset subscription, catering to the ever-growing demand for a comprehensive creative solution. This acquisition expands Shutterstock&#8217;s reach into faster-growing audiences, including freelancers, hobbyists, small businesses, and agencies.</p>
<h2 class="font-bold">A Fusion of Creative Forces</h2>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The combination of Shutterstock and Envato promises to be a powerful force in the creative content industry. By joining forces, the companies will:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 -mt-1">
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Bolster Shutterstock&#8217;s subscriber base to a staggering 1.15 million, more than doubling its current reach.</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Enhance Shutterstock&#8217;s content library with an impressive 10 million images, 6 million videos, 1 million audio clips, 0.5 million templates, and 0.2 million graphics and fonts.</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Diversify Shutterstock&#8217;s offerings into new content types, including code and web themes, product mock-ups, fonts, and templates for slides, PowerPoint, Keynote, WordPress, video, social media designs, gaming, podcasts, and print-on-demand.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="font-bold">A Shared Vision for Creativity and Innovation</h2>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled about this transaction and looking forward to welcoming the Envato team to Shutterstock,&#8221; said Shutterstock CEO Paul Hennessy. &#8220;Envato is perfectly positioned to serve a growing customer need for an unlimited multi-asset subscription to a library of creative content, with an emphasis on videos, audio, graphics, fonts and templates. By extending our reach to faster growing audiences and into additional content types, this acquisition will help Shutterstock fulfill its mission of connecting customers to the content they need, wherever they are so they can create, build and share their next big idea.&#8221;</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Envato CEO Hichame Assi shared his excitement, stating, &#8220;Since its humble beginnings in a Sydney garage, Envato has generated more than $1.3 billion in earnings for its author community and scaled to 650k subscribers. I feel an immense sense of pride in the team for achieving this global scale as an independent business. As we enter this next chapter, we remain laser focused on empowering the creative community to thrive and excited to achieve this shared goal with Shutterstock.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="font-bold">A Promising Future for Creatives and Customers</h2>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">With this acquisition, Shutterstock and Envato are poised to redefine the creative content industry, delivering unparalleled value and empowering creatives and businesses alike to bring their boldest ideas to life. As the companies embark on this exciting journey, their shared commitment to innovation, creativity, and customer satisfaction will undoubtedly shape a future where limitless possibilities await.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Stay tuned for further updates as this groundbreaking merger unfolds, promising to unlock new horizons in the world of creative content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of digital marketing is complex, and SaaS companies need a strong online presence to compete. Search engine optimization (SEO) is essential to drive traffic and expand your customer base. Handling SEO internally can be time-consuming and requires constant learning.  By outsourcing to an experienced SEO expert, you gain valuable time and tap into specialized knowledge. At Profit By PPC, we offer customized <a href="https://profitbyppc.com/digital-marketing-consultant" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>digital marketing consulting</b></a> and PPC solutions for ambitious SaaS companies.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s discuss how partnering with an SEO specialist can propel your SaaS business forward.</p>
<h2><b>1. Deep Understanding of SaaS-Specific SEO</b></h2>
<p>The world of SaaS (software-as-a-service) comes with unique SEO challenges and opportunities. Search engines evaluate SaaS websites through a different lens compared to traditional business or e-commerce sites. An expert <b>SEO consultant for SAAS Company</b> has honed their skills within this specific domain. They possess the intricate knowledge to craft strategies tailored to your industry, ensuring your website&#8217;s content and structure align perfectly with how potential customers search for your type of solution.</p>
<h2><b>2. Expertise in Technical SEO</b></h2>
<p>Technical SEO forms the bedrock of a high-ranking website. Seemingly small errors like broken links, slow loading speeds, or indexing issues can significantly impede your visibility in search results. An SEO consultant conducts a comprehensive technical audit, pinpointing these potential roadblocks and fixing them. This attention to detail ensures that search engine crawlers can easily understand and index your website effectively, leading to improved rankings.</p>
<h2><b>3. Effective Keyword Research</b></h2>
<p>Identifying the right keywords is like finding the hidden treasure map to SEO success. An SEO consultant understands your target audience deeply. They&#8217;ll delve into their pain points, their needs, and, most importantly, the words and phrases they use to search for solutions like yours. This research forms the basis of your content strategy and marketing campaigns, ensuring you&#8217;re strategically targeting those high-value keywords.</p>
<h2><b>4. High-Quality Content Creation</b></h2>
<p>Content is truly king in the SEO world, but not just any content. An SEO expert understands the delicate balance between search intent and valuable, informative content. They can collaborate with your team to develop blog posts, product pages, landing pages, and thought-leadership articles that resonate with your audience. This high-quality, keyword-optimised content builds trust, establishes authority, and draws in the right visitors.</p>
<h2><b>5. Optimised On-Page SEO</b></h2>
<p>Beyond your website&#8217;s content, numerous on-page factors affect your search engine rankings. A skilled SEO consultant pays meticulous attention to elements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Meta Titles and Descriptions</b>: These snippets of text displayed in search results need to be compelling and keyword-rich to entice clicks.</li>
<li><b>Header Tags</b>: Proper structure (H1, H2, etc.) helps search engines understand the hierarchy of your content.</li>
<li><b>Image Optimisation:</b> Alt-text and file sizes play a role in how images are indexed and contribute to page load speed.</li>
<li><b>Internal Linking:</b> A well-structured internal linking strategy distributes authority throughout your site, improving navigation for both visitors and search engines.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>6. Link-Building Strategies</b></h2>
<p>Link building, also known as backlinking, involves acquiring high-quality links to your website from other reputable sources. Search engines view these links as endorsements of your content, boosting your authority and trustworthiness. An SEO consultant won&#8217;t rely on spammy tactics but will develop legitimate link-building campaigns aligned with your niche. The result is a stronger backlink profile and an upward trajectory in search rankings.</p>
<h2><b>7. Competitive Analysis</b></h2>
<p>Gaining an edge in a competitive market requires knowing your rivals&#8217; moves. An experienced SEO consultant dissects your competitors&#8217; online presence, uncovering their strengths, weaknesses, and areas where you can outsmart them. Armed with these insights, we&#8217;ll develop SEO tactics that put you ahead of the pack.</p>
<h2><b>8. Local SEO</b></h2>
<p>SaaS businesses often serve clients across the globe. However, if your customer base is concentrated in a particular location or region, local SEO is essential. An SEO consultant helps you rank prominently in &#8220;near me&#8221; searches, driving leads from your geographic area. Tactics include optimising your Google My Business listing and targeting locally relevant keywords.</p>
<h2><b>9. Data-Driven Insights</b></h2>
<p>SEO isn&#8217;t a set-it-and-forget-it activity. Success depends on continuous analysis and improvement. An expert consultant leverages analytics tools to track an array of metrics, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Search Rankings</b>: Monitoring Your Position for Essential Keywords</li>
<li><b>Website Traffic</b>: Understanding Traffic Sources and Visitor Demographics</li>
<li><b>Conversions</b>: tracking leads, trials, and subscriptions generated from organic search</li>
<li><b>Bounce Rate</b>: Identifying pages that need optimisation to retain visitors</li>
</ul>
<p>These data-driven insights illuminate what&#8217;s working and what needs adjustment, allowing us to refine your SEO strategy for maximum impact.</p>
<h2><b>10. Saves You Time and Money</b></h2>
<p>Building a robust internal SEO team is a costly endeavour.  Hiring a dedicated SEO expert, plus investing in necessary tools and subscriptions, quickly adds up. Partnering with a skilled SEO consultant for SaaS companies offers several financial benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Specialised Expertise</b>: You gain immediate access to proven knowledge and strategies without the expense of hiring and training in-house.</li>
<li><b>Scalability</b>: <a href="https://profitbyppc.com/seo-services-for-saas-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>SEO services for SaaS Company</b></a> can scale alongside your business growth without the need to expand your payroll.</li>
<li><b>Focused Investment</b>: Your budget is directed towards results-driven strategies, avoiding inefficient spending on tactics that don&#8217;t deliver.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Let Us Drive Your SaaS Growth </b></h2>
<p>At Profit By PPC, we&#8217;re passionate about helping SaaS businesses excel in the digital landscape. Our team of digital marketing and PPC experts understands the intricacies of SaaS SEO. We tailor solutions aligned with your unique goals, taking a methodical, data-informed approach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In modern business, customer management is vital for success. As businesses expand, handling more customers becomes tougher but essential. Onboarding new customers can strain services, hinder sales, and lower satisfaction. To tackle this challenge, businesses rely on CRM software to manage customers, boost sales, and improve service.</p>
<h2>What is CRM and Why do You Need It?</h2>
<p>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) encompasses the technology utilized to oversee all interactions and relationships with both current and potential customers within a company. The primary aim is to enhance business connections. A CRM system aids in maintaining customer engagement, streamlining operations, and ultimately boosting profitability.</p>
<p>Typically, when discussing CRM, reference is made to a CRM system or platform—an instrument facilitating contact management, sales supervision, productivity enhancement, and more.</p>
<p>CRM software directs attention towards nurturing relationships within your organization, whether with customers, service recipients, colleagues, or suppliers, across their entire lifecycle. This includes acquiring new customers, securing their patronage, and providing ongoing support and additional services throughout the association.</p>
<p>Through the utilization of a CRM solution, the sales and marketing team can monitor and follow a customer’s journey(check out <a href="https://www.sprinklr.com/cxm/customer-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>what is customer journey</b></a>) of engagement with the business. This meticulous oversight enables the refinement of each customer interaction, thereby enriching their overall experience.</p>
<h2>Functionality of CRM Software</h2>
<h3>Sales Forecasting</h3>
<p>CRM software uses historical data and predictive analytics for accurate sales forecasting. By analyzing trends, businesses make informed decisions about resource allocation and planning. Forecasting helps anticipate demand fluctuations, optimize production, and minimize risks.</p>

<h3>Opportunity Management</h3>
<p>CRM empowers sales teams with tools to manage opportunities throughout the sales cycle. Centralizing data enables prioritization, tracking, and nurturing of leads. Advanced features streamline processes, increase efficiency, and maximize conversion rates.</p>
<h3>Time Tracking</h3>
<p>CRM software includes time-tracking capabilities for sales activities. Capturing detailed data helps identify inefficiencies and improve resource allocation. Monitoring performance enables targeted coaching and enhances productivity.</p>
<h3>Real-Time Reporting</h3>
<p>CRM solutions offer customizable reporting tools for instant visibility into key metrics. Stakeholders can monitor progress, identify trends, and address issues proactively. Real-time insights enable agile decision-making, driving continuous improvement and business success.</p>
<h3>Customer Management</h3>
<p>At the heart of CRM lies a robust framework for managing customer information comprehensively. It enables businesses to create detailed profiles, capturing data like purchase history, preferences, and interactions. This holistic view empowers tailored interactions, personalized marketing, and informed decision-making. By consolidating data from various touchpoints, CRM enhances understanding, leading to better <a href="https://www.sprinklr.com/cxm/customer-retention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>customer retention</b></a> and loyalty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most annoying mistakes MTN made with their latest MiFi device is putting the sticky paper label OUTSIDE the body of the MiFi device. Perhaps, this could be because this particular Mi-fi model has no removable battery cover, but they could have at least, laminated it. The sad news, however, is that many MTN Mi-Fi owners have lost the default WLAN Key written on the sticky label due to the rubbing off of the ink used to print the details.</p>
<p>But do not fret&#8230; My name is Yusuf Odukoya, and as a freelancer and digital guy myself, I understand that losing that little sticker with your WLAN key can be quite frustrating. I have got you covered with this simple and effective solution to regain access to your Wi-Fi connection by checking or setting a new WLAN Key.</p>
<p>In this step-by-step guide, I will walk you through the process of resetting or checking your MTN MiFi WLAN key (Also known as WiFi password) using just a USB cable and your computer. Whether you&#8217;ve got the latest MTN Mi-Fi model or an older one, this method just works for ALL MTN Mi-Fi models. So, let&#8217;s dive in and get your Wi-Fi back up and running!</p>
<p><strong>Materials You&#8217;ll Need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your MTN MiFi device</li>
<li>A USB cable</li>
<li>A computer or laptop with a web browser</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 1: Connect MiFi to Your Computer</strong> Start by powering on your MTN MiFi device. Then, take your trusty USB cable and connect your MiFi device to your computer. Ensure the connection is snug and secure.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Accessing the Web Interface</strong> Open up your favorite web browser on your computer—whether it&#8217;s Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or another. Now, in the address bar at the top, type in the following: <code>192.168.0.1</code> and hit Enter. This magical combination of numbers will lead you to your MiFi device&#8217;s settings.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Logging In</strong><br />
You&#8217;ll be greeted by the MTN MiFi web interface. Sometimes, it might ask you for a username and password. If you&#8217;ve never changed these before, no worries! The default credentials are often &#8220;admin&#8221; for both the username and password. Go ahead and enter those in.</p>
<div id="attachment_18010" style="width: 849px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18010" class="size-full wp-image-18010" title="Dashboard login page" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Dashboard-login-page.png" alt="Dashboard login page" width="839" height="589" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Dashboard-login-page.png 839w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Dashboard-login-page-300x211.png 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Dashboard-login-page-768x539.png 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Dashboard-login-page-480x337.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px" /><p id="caption-attachment-18010" class="wp-caption-text">Dashboard login page</p></div>
<p><strong>Step 4: Finding WLAN Settings</strong><br />
Now comes the fun part—finding the section that&#8217;s all about your Wi-Fi settings because this depends on your MiFi or router model. You must look for labels like &#8220;WLAN Settings,&#8221; &#8220;WiFi Settings,&#8221; or something similar. Once you&#8217;ve located it, click on it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s mine:</p>
<div id="attachment_18011" style="width: 1008px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18011" class="size-full wp-image-18011" title="WiFi Settings" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WiFi-Settings.png" alt="WiFi Settings" width="998" height="486" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WiFi-Settings.png 998w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WiFi-Settings-300x146.png 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WiFi-Settings-768x374.png 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WiFi-Settings-480x234.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px" /><p id="caption-attachment-18011" class="wp-caption-text">WiFi Settings</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Generating a New WLAN Key</strong><br />
Inside the WLAN settings, you&#8217;ll find an option to generate a fresh WLAN key or password.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://branditechture.agency/brand-logos/download/oraimo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oraimo</a> (stylized as <em><strong>oraimo</strong></em>) is a well-known smart accessories manufacturing firm that designs, develops, and distributes smartwatches, power banks, audio, and other accessories for consumers in over 13 countries. However, their marketing strategy has come into question recently, and people are starting to ask whether it is sustainable in the long run.</p>
<p>If you visit the official Oraimo Nigeria store <strong>(https://ng.oraimo.com/)</strong>, you will notice that they only approve positive comments and outrightly decline negative, but valid ones.</p>
<div id="attachment_17966" style="width: 1541px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17966" class="size-full wp-image-17966" title="Oraimo's NG Store" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Oraimos-NG-Store.png" alt="Oraimo's NG Store" width="1531" height="889" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Oraimos-NG-Store.png 1531w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Oraimos-NG-Store-300x174.png 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Oraimos-NG-Store-1024x595.png 1024w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Oraimos-NG-Store-768x446.png 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Oraimos-NG-Store-480x279.png 480w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Oraimos-NG-Store-1320x766.png 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1531px) 100vw, 1531px" /><p id="caption-attachment-17966" class="wp-caption-text">Oraimo&#8217;s NG Store</p></div>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s suspicious that no product has less than a 5/5 star rating on their store.  This raises questions about whether they generate artificial positive comments and star ratings to influence purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>Moreover, Oraimo is known to hire local influencers such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=miss+techy+oraimo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MissTechy</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Fosudo+oraimo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Fisayo Fosudo</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Kegan+Tech+oraimo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kegan Tech</strong></a>, to put their products in good light while &#8220;deliberately&#8221; downplaying the cons. &#8220;Commercial&#8221; tech influencers have contributed to this rot as they do not live long enough with these products to genuinely form an opinion.</p>
<p>As a consumer, whenever you openly criticize Oraimo on their Facebook posts, they delete the comment. Even if you repost the comment a hundred times, they will delete all of them in a matter of minutes. There seem to be people specifically employed to carry out this task, but how about they use that same energy to reach out to the pained customer via DM?</p>
<p>While this might seem to them like a clever PR strategy in the short run, the question is, how long can a brand keep up with this strategy? Deceptive marketing practices can only work for so long before people start to catch on. Once people realize that they can&#8217;t trust a brand, it&#8217;s challenging to regain their trust.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the internet is too vast to control every negative comment about your brand. Social media has made it easier for people to share their experiences with a brand, and if a brand tries to control information, it could end up doing them more harm than good.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Oraimo&#8217;s deceptive marketing strategy raises questions about the sustainability of such practices in the long run. While it might seem like a good idea to control information about your brand, it&#8217;s not sustainable in the long run.</p>
<p>What do you think? Let&#8217;s discuss this in the comments section below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google Chrome is without a doubt one of the most popular web browsers available today, thanks to its simplicity, reliability, and ecosystem of browser extensions. However, due to its high resource demands, users who are running low on system resources, such as RAM or CPU, may find it challenging to keep the browser running smoothly. To address this issue, Chrome comes with a feature called &#8220;Memory saver,&#8221; which can help save system resources by suspending tabs that are not in use.</p>
<p>While this feature can be a boon to some users, it is a curse for others: Take, for example, Graphic Designers or Product Designers who switch frequently between <em>Shutterstock</em>, <em>icons8</em>, and <em>Figma</em>. To summarize this scenario, the Chrome Memory Saver feature will slow down your workflow and spike CPU resource usage if you frequently switch between multiple tabs or need to access certain previously opened websites very often and quickly. This is because the page would need to be reloaded after being idle for, say 5 minutes.</p>
<h2>How Chrome&#8217;s Memory Saver Works</h2>
<p>The Chrome browser memory saver feature works by identifying tabs that have been inactive for a specific period, typically five minutes. Once a tab is deemed inactive, the browser suspends it, freeing up system resources that would have been used to keep the tab running in the background. When a user clicks on the suspended tab, the page is automatically reloaded and the user can continue from where they left off. This process is designed to help users save system resources and keep the browser running smoothly, especially on devices with limited RAM or CPU.</p>
<h2>The Drawbacks of Enabling Memory Saver on Chrome</h2>
<p>The downside of the memory saver feature is that it can slow down your workflow, especially if you frequently switch between tabs or use certain websites regularly. For instance, if you are working on a research project and need to refer to multiple web pages simultaneously, the memory saver feature may suspend some of your tabs, making it difficult to access the information you need quickly. You may have to wait for a few seconds for the tab to reload, which can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially if you are working on a tight deadline.</p>
<p>Moreover, the memory saver feature can also interfere with certain web applications, such as online banking, user registration, survey websites, or shopping websites. These types of sites often require constant updates and real-time data transmission to stay alive, and suspending them can cause errors or glitches in the application. This can result in frustration for the user and may even lead to data loss or financial losses in the case of online banking.</p>
<p>Luckily, you can create exceptions by &#8220;whitelisting&#8221; some websites from inside Chrome&#8217;s <strong>performance</strong> settings, or you can disable Chrome&#8217;s memory saver feature altogether.</p>
<h3>How To Disable Chrome&#8217;s Memory Saver</h3>
<div id="attachment_17862" style="width: 752px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17862" class="size-full wp-image-17862" title="Memory Saver toggle screen" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Memory-Saver-toggle-screen.png" alt="Memory Saver toggle screen" width="742" height="281" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Memory-Saver-toggle-screen.png 742w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Memory-Saver-toggle-screen-300x114.png 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Memory-Saver-toggle-screen-480x182.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /><p id="caption-attachment-17862" class="wp-caption-text">Memory Saver toggle screen</p></div>
<p>Chrome&#8217;s Memory Saver is often enabled by default in recent versions of the browser. However, if you have made up your mind to disable this feature, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Chrome on your computer.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>three dots</strong> icon in the top-right corner of the browser window.</li>
<li>Select &#8220;<strong>Settings</strong>&#8221; from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Look at the pane on your left, and click on &#8220;<strong>Performance</strong>&#8220;.</li>
<li>Use the switch to toggle the <strong>Memory Saver</strong> feature.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also add a list of sites to be kept active even though memory saver is left enabled. The choice is all yours.</p>
<p>Note that disabling the Memory Saver feature may cause Chrome to use more system resources and may slow down your browser&#8217;s performance. If you have a device with very limited RAM or CPU, and switch tabs less frequently, it is better to keep the feature enabled.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, while Chrome&#8217;s memory saver feature can be a helpful tool for users who are struggling with limited system resources, it can also slow down your workflow, especially if you frequently switch between tabs or use multiple websites regularly. If you find yourself missing deadlines often, it&#8217;s time to look towards the memory saver feature, you may consider disabling it. Ultimately, it is really up to you to decide whether the memory saver feature is a helpful tool or a hindrance to your workflow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have come across the word &#8220;copy&#8221; in a different context before, but in <a href="https://branditechture.agency/20-content-generation-ideas-for-your-brands-marketing/">content marketing</a>, &#8220;copy&#8221; refers to the text that is used to communicate a message to an audience.</p>
<p>The word, &#8220;Copy&#8221; can be used to refer to anything from blog posts and articles to sales pages and product descriptions. The goal of copy in content marketing is to inform, educate, or persuade the reader to take a specific action, such as purchasing a product or signing up for a newsletter.</p>
<p>Copywriting is the act of creating this written content, and a person who specializes in this type of writing is called a copywriter.</p>
<h3>What is the Difference between copywriting and content writing?</h3>
<p>Copywriting and <a href="https://branditechture.agency/writing-content-for-a-website-read-these-golden-tips/">content writing</a> are similar in that they both involve creating written content, but they have some key differences.</p>
<p>Copywriting is focused on creating persuasive, sales-oriented text that is designed to get the reader to take a specific action, such as purchasing a product or signing up for a service. Content writing, on the other hand, is focused on creating informative and engaging text that provides value to the reader.</p>
<p>Content writing is often used to support the goals of a content marketing strategy by providing useful information to the reader and building trust and credibility for the brand.</p>
<h3>What are the types of copy we have in marketing?</h3>
<p>There are many different types of copy used in marketing. Some examples include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sales copy: This type of copy is used to persuade the reader to make a purchase. It typically includes a highlight of the benefits of the product or service being sold, and a strong call-to-action <a href="https://branditechture.agency/7-amazing-microcopy-tips-for-ux-designers/">microcopy</a> to nudge the reader to make a purchase.</li>
<li>Landing page copy: This type of copy is used on a website&#8217;s landing page, which is the first page a visitor sees when they arrive on the site. It is designed to grab the reader&#8217;s attention and convince them to take a specific action, such as filling out a form or making a purchase.</li>
<li>Email copy: This type of copy is used in email marketing campaigns. It is designed to engage the reader and encourage them to take a specific action, such as clicking a link or making a purchase.</li>
<li>Social media copy: This type of copy is used on social media platforms to engage followers and promote products or services. It is often concise and attention-grabbing, and may include hashtags and links to relevant content.</li>
<li>Blog post copy: This type of copy is used in blog posts and articles. It is designed to inform and educate the reader and may include links to other resources or calls-to-action.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few examples of the many types of copy used in marketing. The specific type of copy that is used will depend on the goals of the marketing campaign and the target audience.</p>
<h3>What are the features of an effective copy?</h3>
<p>An effective copy should have several key features, including:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A clear and compelling message:</strong> The copy should have a clear and concise message that is easy for the reader to understand. It should convey the value of the product or service being offered and convince the reader to take action.</li>
<li><strong>A strong call-to-action:</strong> The copy should include a strong call-to-action that tells the reader exactly what they should do next. This could be to make a purchase, sign up for a newsletter, or follow the business on social media.</li>
<li><strong>Relevance to the target audience:</strong> The copy should be relevant to the target audience and address their needs and concerns. By understanding the audience&#8217;s pain points and interests, businesses can create copy that resonates with them and motivates them to take action.</li>
<li><strong>Use of persuasive techniques:</strong> The copy should use persuasive techniques, such as testimonials, social proof, and scarcity, to convince the reader to take action. By leveraging these techniques, businesses can create copy that is more effective at persuading the reader.</li>
<li><strong>Proper grammar and spelling:</strong> The copy should be well-written, with proper grammar and spelling. This helps to ensure that the message is clear and easy to understand, and it helps to build trust and credibility with the reader.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, an effective copy should be clear, concise, persuasive, and relevant to the target audience. By incorporating these features, businesses can create copy that is more effective at achieving their marketing goals.</p>
<h3>What are the benefits of effective copy?</h3>
<p>Effective copy has many benefits, both for the business and for the audience. Some of the key benefits of effective copy include:</p>
<p><strong>Increased sales:</strong> Effective copy is designed to persuade the reader to take a specific action, such as making a purchase. By creating compelling and persuasive copy, businesses can increase their sales and revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Improved customer engagement:</strong> Good copy is engaging and interesting, which can help to keep the reader&#8217;s attention and encourage them to take action. By providing valuable and interesting information, businesses can build trust and credibility with their audience.</p>
<p><strong>Increased website traffic:</strong> Effective copy can help to drive more traffic to a business&#8217;s website. This can be achieved through search engine optimization (SEO) techniques, such as using relevant keywords, or through social media marketing and email marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Better brand awareness:</strong> Effective copy can help to improve a business&#8217;s brand awareness. By creating consistent and compelling messaging, businesses can build their brand and <a href="https://branditechture.agency/how-to-build-a-unique-brand/">differentiate themselves from their competitors</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://branditechture.agency/personal-or-corporate-branding/">professional </a>email signature banner is a great place to include your contact information, such as your phone number, email address, and website. This can make it easy for the recipient to get in touch with you, and can also help to promote your personal or professional brand.</p>
<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>Overall, a creative email signature banner is an important tool for professionals. It can help with branding, building trust, making a good first impression, and providing important contact information.</p>
<p>I personally use email signature banners as a silent marketing tool because they are a subtle yet effective way to promote my brand, showcase my expertise, and provide important contact information to recipients of my emails. Since email signature banners are automatically included in every email that a person sends,  it simply means that it can reach a wide audience without the need for additional effort or resources.</p>
<p>By now, you should agree with me that an email signature banner is a non-intrusive way to promote your brand or services. It is included at the bottom of the email, so it does not disrupt the main content of the message. This can make it more effective than more overt forms of marketing, such as advertisements, promotional emails, email blasts, or WhatsApp broadcasts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can have as much WordPress plugins as your project requires, but here are simple rules to follow in order to minimize conflicts.</p>
<p>Before I tell you, let&#8217;s explain and categorise what &#8220;conflicts&#8221; actually mean.</p>
<p>Plugin conflicts can be categorized into three major categories;</p>
<h4>1. Performance Conflict</h4>
<p>Website slows down noticeably as a result of resource overusage due to conflicting plugins. This is technically known as &#8220;resource hogging&#8221;</p>
<h4>2. Visual Conflict</h4>
<p>The website rendering is distorted or incomplete. This can happen when CSS or JS files are fully or partially unable to load. This is commonly caused by conflicting caching plugins.</p>
<h4>3. Functional Conflict</h4>
<p>This can impact the functionality of the website, causing some features not to work even though the website seems to load fine.</p>
<p>A plugin conflict can cause your website to suffer from either of the three categories above, or a combination of two or more categories.</p>
<h2>How To Avoid Conflicts When Using Multiple Plugins</h2>
<p>As you could see in the screenie below, I have a WordPress site that loads fairly fast, and it uses over 53 Plugins.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17359" title="Screenshot 2022 09 06 122010" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-06-122010.png" alt="Screenshot 2022 09 06 122010" width="528" height="163" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-06-122010.png 528w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-06-122010-300x93.png 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-06-122010-480x148.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" /></p>
<p><strong>Here are two golden rules to follow when installing/activating plugins:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Never activate two different plugins that do the same job.</li>
<li>Never activate the same feature from different sources. For example, if two plugins provide the &#8220;Lazy Load&#8221; feature, only activate it from one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you are able to abide by these two golden rules, you&#8217;d be ruling out any chance of plugin conflicts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sky is truly the the limit as a British Airways advertising campaign from 2013 showed us. The ad campaigned titled &#8220;<strong>#lookup</strong>&#8220;, which was created by the popular marketing agency, OgilvyOne, stretched the boundaries of billboard advertising by combining old and new techniques to give the world something <span>unprecedented</span>.</p>
<h2>The Concept Behind the Amazing British Airways Billboard</h2>
<p>British Airways is the largest airline in the United Kingdom in terms of fleet size, route network, and revenue. However, the sector is fiercely competitive, and the company continues to strive for new heights with its advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>As a result, two digital billboards were created in London. These particular placards were placed between the public&#8217;s view and the flight paths of planes arriving and departing from Heathrow Airport. The display was upgraded with advanced technology that could follow planes as they flew overhead, and that&#8217;s when the magic began.</p>
<p>A video of a toddler pointing at an airplane and running after it would begin to play. The sign would also display the flight number and location from whence the plane took off, before returning to a very basic British Airways display.</p>
<div style="width: 940px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-13939-1" width="940" height="529" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-british-airline-billboard-in-london-where-a-kid-points-to-airplane-SD.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-british-airline-billboard-in-london-where-a-kid-points-to-airplane-SD.mp4">https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-british-airline-billboard-in-london-where-a-kid-points-to-airplane-SD.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Inspired the British Airways Billboard Design?</h2>
<div id="attachment_13942" style="width: 1035px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13942" class="size-full wp-image-13942" title="British Airways Billboard boy tracking airplane" src="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/British-Airways-Billboard-boy-tracking-airplane.jpg" alt="British Airways Billboard boy tracking airplane" width="1025" height="683" srcset="https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/British-Airways-Billboard-boy-tracking-airplane.jpg 1025w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/British-Airways-Billboard-boy-tracking-airplane-300x200.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/British-Airways-Billboard-boy-tracking-airplane-768x512.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.agency/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/British-Airways-Billboard-boy-tracking-airplane-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px" /><p id="caption-attachment-13942" class="wp-caption-text">British Airways Billboard showing boy tracking an airplane and displaying real time flight details.</p></div>
<p>British Airways went into the campaign with a few major objectives, one of which was to remind customers of the airline&#8217;s many global destinations. They also wanted to highlight some newer destinations in the hopes of encouraging customers to visit the British Airways website and book a flight.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this wasn&#8217;t a simple hashtag-advertising effort. It was all based on a strategy that would allow customers to <a href="https://branditechture.agency/7-secrets-to-building-and-sustaining-brand-equity/">engage emotionally</a> with the brand. People often imagine themselves on their way to an exotic area when they look up at planes in the sky, and this billboard managed to bring back those childhood memories for everyone who saw it. The use of a child allowed viewers to connect with their feelings of being awestruck by flight as a child, while also avoiding all the disappointment caused by misplaced luggage and extended delays.</p>
<h2>The Technology Behind the British Airways Billboard</h2>
<p>The billboard used a surveillance system that was particularly created for this campaign to ensure that it tracked real planes and that the video was timed with the planes as they flew by.</p>
<p>It employed a specific antenna that could register the transponders of all aircraft within a specified radius to figure out which plane it was. Many more aspects were taken into account throughout the programming. For example, it considered the plane&#8217;s height, the sky&#8217;s cloud cover, and the light (or lack thereof) to guarantee that people could see what they were supposed to see.</p>
<h2>How the Internet Responded to the British Airways Billboard</h2>
<p>The campaign&#8217;s own website, ba.com/lookup (which now redirects to britishairways.com/lookup), was established exclusively for it. It was created to make it simple for clients to transform their desires into bookings, allowing them to spend more time packing their belongings. It seems to be effective, as it received over <strong>43,300 unique visitors.</strong></p>
<p>The sign&#8217;s video has been viewed over 1.3 million times online, and the campaign has received over 45 million social media impressions. The hashtag <strong>#Lookup</strong> was put beneath the video and was used over 3,400 times on Twitter.</p>

<h2>Also Approved by the Advertising World</h2>
<p>The Ogilvy 12th Floor agency created the entire campaign, which was a huge success. The campaign won the Direct Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Similar ideas have been explored before in other parts of the world, but this was the first of its sort in the UK.</p>
<h2>The British Airways Billboard Uses a Combination of Digital and Traditional Marketing</h2>
<p>One of the most important lessons to learn from this campaign is that technological advancements do not always have to imply the demise of more traditional types of advertising. Print advertisements may appear to be less relevant than online ads that keep buyers one click away from making a purchase, but digital developments can bring certain platforms full circle. In a world of clickable computer code, a massive video could be exactly what you need to stand out.</p>
<h2>The Effects of Outdoor Advertising on Other Businesses</h2>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re not an airline firm, there&#8217;s always a method to use outdoor advertising to promote your brand using modern technologies. If you need help with getting your brand on a billboard, <a href="https://branditechture.agency/contact/">get in touch with us</a>, but first make sure your seat and tray table are fully upright and latched!</p>
